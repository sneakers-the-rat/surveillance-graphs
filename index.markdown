abstract: This is where the abstract would go. There would be about a paragraph of text in it, and it would go over several lines. It occupies space and that should be accounted for in the design. Right around here we are probably pivoting to some list of things that are included in the piece after briefly setting the stage. Then in just a second we'll make some claims and then state the basic thesis of the piece.
