  abstract = {ABSTRACT This study aims to understand the drivers behind the usage habits of voice assistants (VAs). To do so, we extend the Technology Acceptance Model in conjunction with the concept of privacy cynicism, a cognitive process that remains understudied in the academic literature. The model is validated using PLS analysis through Smart-PLS. Data gathered via MTurk includes 265 actual VAs users. It is observed that ease of use and perceived usefulness have a positive impact on attitude toward the usage of VAs, while privacy cynicism has a negative impact. Moreover, it is found that privacy cynicism has a positive impact on trust based on the usage of VAs. Interestingly, attitudes toward the usage of VAs does not fully explain the consumers' VA usage habits},

  abstract = {This paper presents first successful steps in designing search agents that learn meta-strategies for iterative query refinement in information-seeking tasks. Our approach uses machine reading to guide the selection of refinement terms from aggregated search results. Agents are then empowered with simple but effective search operators to exert fine-grained and transparent control over queries and search results. We develop a novel way of generating synthetic search sessions, which leverages the power of transformer-based language models through (self-)supervised learning. We also present a reinforcement learning agent with dynamically constrained actions that learns interactive search strategies from scratch. Our search agents obtain retrieval and answer quality performance comparable to recent neural methods, using only a traditional term-based BM25 ranking function and interpretable discrete reranking and filtering actions.},

  abstract = {Neural retrieval models have superseded classic bag-of-words methods such as BM25 as the retrieval framework of choice. However, neural systems lack the interpretability of bag-of-words models; it is not trivial to connect a query change to a change in the latent space that ultimately determines the retrieval results. To shed light on this embedding space, we learn a "query decoder" that, given a latent representation of a neural search engine, generates the corresponding query. We show that it is possible to decode a meaningful query from its latent representation and, when moving in the right direction in latent space, to decode a query that retrieves the relevant paragraph. In particular, the query decoder can be useful to understand "what should have been asked" to retrieve a particular paragraph from the collection. We employ the query decoder to generate a large synthetic dataset of query reformulations for MSMarco, leading to improved retrieval performance. On this data, we train a pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) T5 model for the application of query suggestion that outperforms both query reformulation and PRF information retrieval baselines.},

  abstract = {Large language models can produce fluent dialogue but often hallucinate factual inaccuracies. While retrieval-augmented models help alleviate this issue, they still face a difficult challenge of both reasoning to provide correct knowledge and generating conversation simultaneously. In this work, we propose a modular model, Knowledge to Response (K2R), for incorporating knowledge into conversational agents, which breaks down this problem into two easier steps. K2R first generates a knowledge sequence, given a dialogue context, as an intermediate step. After this"reasoning step", the model then attends to its own generated knowledge sequence, as well as the dialogue context, to produce a final response. In detailed experiments, we find that such a model hallucinates less in knowledge-grounded dialogue tasks, and has advantages in terms of interpretability and modularity. In particular, it can be used to fuse QA and dialogue systems together to enable dialogue agents to give knowledgeable answers, or QA models to give conversational responses in a zero-shot setting.},

If IR systems are weak, these metrics undersample or completely filter out the deeper documents that need improvement. If IR systems are relatively strong, these metrics undersample deeper relevant documents that could underpin even stronger IR systems, ones that could present content from tens or hundreds of relevant documents in a user-digestible hierarchy or text summary. We reanalyze over 70 TREC tracks from the past 28 years, showing that roughly half undersample top ranked documents and nearly all undersample tail documents. We show that in the 2020 Deep Learning tracks, neural systems were actually near-optimal at top-ranked documents, compared to only modest gains over BM25 on tail documents. Our analysis is based on a simple new systems-oriented metric, 'atomized search length', which is capable of accurately and evenly measuring all relevant documents at any depth.},

Conceptualizing algorithms as ethicopolitical entities that are entangled with the data attributes of people, Amoore outlines how algorithms give incomplete accounts of themselves, learn through relationships with human practices, and exist in the world in ways that exceed their source code. In these ways, algorithms and their relations to people cannot be understood by simply examining their code, nor can ethics be encoded into algorithms. Instead, Amoore locates the ethical responsibility of algorithms in the conditions of partiality and opacity that haunt both human and algorithmic decisions. To this end, she proposes what she calls cloud ethics\textemdash an approach to holding algorithms accountable by engaging with the social and technical conditions under which they emerge and operate.},

Clinicians who work in transgender health must understand the difference between the diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria as defined and described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the notion of this term as used to assess eligibility for transition-related interventions such as hormone-replacement therapy and surgery. Unnecessary diagnoses due to the belief that a diagnosis is clinically required to access transition-related care can contribute to stigma and discrimination toward trans individuals.},

  abstract = {SPARQL query services that balance processing between clients and servers become more and more essential to handle the increasing load for open and decentralized knowledge graphs on the Web. To this end, Linked Data Fragments (LDF) have introduced a foundational framework that has sparked research exploring a spectrum of potential Web querying interfaces in between server-side query processing via SPARQL endpoints and client-side query processing of data dumps. Current proposals in between typically suffer from imbalanced load on either the client or the server. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first work that combines both client-side and server-side query optimization techniques in a truly dynamic fashion: we introduce WiseKG, a system that employs a cost model that dynamically delegates the load between servers and clients by combining client-side processing of shipped partitions with efficient server-side processing of star-shaped sub-queries, based on current server workload and client capabilities. Our experiments show that WiseKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of average total query execution time per client, while at the same time decreasing network traffic and increasing server-side availability.},

The advancement of experimental hardware also empowers researchers to reach a level of accuracy that was not possible in the past. Marching toward the next generation of self-driving laboratories, the orchestration of both resources lies at the focal point of autonomous discovery in chemical science. To achieve such a goal, algorithmically accessible data representations and standardized communication protocols are indispensable. In this perspective, we recategorize the recently introduced approach based on Materials Acceleration Platforms into five functional components and discuss recent case studies that focus on the data representation and exchange scheme between different components. Emerging technologies for interoperable data representation and multi-agent systems are also discussed with their recent applications in chemical automation. We hypothesize that knowledge graph technology, orchestrating semantic web technologies and multi-agent systems, will be the driving force to bring data to knowledge, evolving our way of automating the laboratory.},

During this decade, the field of platform studies established key insights into the conditions, infrastructures and tactics of platforms in a connected society, linking strategies of computational design and architecture with modes of expression and communication. As it has traced both discursive and technical design tactics used to facilitate the `platforming' of the web, platform studies perspectives offer useful insights into the expansion of platform-based architectures and services across diverse and experiential sites of urban exchange.},

This model, it is argued, is much closer to the real behavior of information searchers than the traditional model of information retrieval is, and, consequently, will guide our thinking better in the design of effective interfaces. Second, the research literature of manual information seeking behavior is drawn on for suggestions of capabilities that users might like to have in online systems. Third, based on the new model and the research on information seeking, suggestions are made for how new search capabilities could be incorporated into the design of search interfaces. Particular attention is given to the nature and types of browsing that can be facilitated.},

While some content elements were quite popular, none of them \textemdash{} not even name \textemdash{} was found on all home pages.

We formulate various requirements for a fully-fledged KGMS. In particular, such a system must be capable of performing complex reasoning tasks but, at the same time, achieve efficient and scalable reasoning over Big Data with an acceptable computational complexity. Moreover, a KGMS needs interfaces to corporate databases, the web, and machine-learning and analytics packages. We present KRR formalisms and a system achieving these goals. To this aim, we use specific suitable fragments from the Datalog\$\$\^\textbackslash pm \$\${$\pm$}family of languages, and we introduce the vadalog system, which puts these swift logics into action. This system exploits the theoretical underpinning of relevant Datalog\$\$\^\textbackslash pm \$\${$\pm$}languages and combines it with existing and novel techniques from database and AI practice.},

  abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

  abstract = {This article sets out our perspective on how to begin the journey of decolonising computational fields, such as data and cognitive sciences. We see this struggle as requiring two basic steps: a) realisation that the present-day system has inherited, and still enacts, hostile, conservative, and oppressive behaviours and principles towards women of colour (WoC); and b) rejection of the idea that centering individual people is a solution to system-level problems. The longer we ignore these two steps, the more "our" academic system maintains its toxic structure, excludes, and harms Black women and other minoritised groups. This also keeps the door open to discredited pseudoscience, like eugenics and physiognomy. We propose that grappling with our fields' histories and heritage holds the key to avoiding mistakes of the past. For example, initiatives such as "diversity boards" can still be harmful because they superficially appear reformatory but nonetheless center whiteness and maintain the status quo. Building on the shoulders of many WoC's work, who have been paving the way, we hope to advance the dialogue required to build both a grass-roots and a top-down re-imagining of computational sciences -- including but not limited to psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, data science, statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We aspire for these fields to progress away from their stagnant, sexist, and racist shared past into carving and maintaining an ecosystem where both a diverse demographics of researchers and scientific ideas that critically challenge the status quo are welcomed.},

  abstract = {We have now entered the era of trillion parameter machine learning models trained on billion-sized datasets scraped from the internet. The rise of these gargantuan datasets has given rise to formidable bodies of critical work that has called for caution while generating these large datasets. These address concerns surrounding the dubious curation practices used to generate these datasets, the sordid quality of alt-text data available on the world wide web, the problematic content of the CommonCrawl dataset often used as a source for training large language models, and the entrenched biases in large-scale visio-linguistic models (such as OpenAI's CLIP model) trained on opaque datasets (WebImageText). In the backdrop of these specific calls of caution, we examine the recently released LAION-400M dataset, which is a CLIP-filtered dataset of Image-Alt-text pairs parsed from the Common-Crawl dataset. We found that the dataset contains, troublesome and explicit images and text pairs of rape, pornography, malign stereotypes, racist and ethnic slurs, and other extremely problematic content. We outline numerous implications, concerns and downstream harms regarding the current state of large scale datasets while raising open questions for various stakeholders including the AI community, regulators, policy makers and data subjects.},

  abstract = {Machine learning currently exerts an outsized influence on the world, increasingly affecting institutional practices and impacted communities. It is therefore critical that we question vague conceptions of the field as value-neutral or universally beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is advancing. In this paper, we first introduce a method and annotation scheme for studying the values encoded in documents such as research papers. Applying the scheme, we analyze 100 highly cited machine learning papers published at premier machine learning conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key features of papers which reveal their values: their justification for their choice of project, which attributes of their project they uplift, their consideration of potential negative consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find that few of the papers justify how their project connects to a societal need (15\textbackslash\%) and far fewer discuss negative potential (1\textbackslash\%). Through line-by-line content analysis, we identify 59 values that are uplifted in ML research, and, of these, we find that the papers most frequently justify and assess themselves based on Performance, Generalization, Quantitative evidence, Efficiency, Building on past work, and Novelty. We present extensive textual evidence and identify key themes in the definitions and operationalization of these values. Notably, we find systematic textual evidence that these top values are being defined and applied with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of power.Finally, we find increasingly close ties between these highly cited papers and tech companies and elite universities.},

  abstract = {In this article, we add research on technical integration and dependency to the theories of platformization. Our research seeks to understand how platforms have been able to technically integrate themselves into the fabric of the mobile ecosystem, transforming the economic dynamics that allow these largely enclosed entities to compete. We therefore want to consider platforms as service assemblages to account for the material ways in which they have decomposed and recomposed themselves for developers, enabling them to shift the economic dynamics of competition and monopolization in their favor. This article will argue that this shift in the formation of platform monopolies is being brought about by the decentralization of these services, leading to an overall technical integration of the largest digital platform such as Facebook and Google into the source code of almost all apps. We present new digital methodologies to surface these relations and material conditions of platforms. These methodologies offer us a whole new toolkit to investigate how decentralized services depend on each other and how new power relations are formed.},

Drawing on observations and interviews conducted within the Los Angeles Police Department, I offer an empirical account of how the adoption of big data analytics does?and does not?transform police surveillance practices. I argue that the adoption of big data analytics facilitates amplifications of prior surveillance practices and fundamental transformations in surveillance activities. First, discretionary assessments of risk are supplemented and quantified using risk scores. Second, data are used for predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes. Third, the proliferation of automatic alert systems makes it possible to systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people. Fourth, the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact. Fifth, previously separate data systems are merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of institutions. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model of big data surveillance that can be applied to institutional domains beyond the criminal justice system. Finally, I highlight the social consequences of big data surveillance for law and social inequality.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine \textemdash{} the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology.

To prove her point, she undertakes a series of adventures in computer programming. She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car, concluding ``the cyborg future is not coming any time soon''; uses artificial intelligence to investigate why students can't pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster; and attempts to repair the U.S. campaign finance system by building AI software. If we understand the limits of what we can do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we should do with it to make the world better for everyone.},

Furthermore, we identify the main types of tension associated with standardization and the dynamics they generate in each of those three areas, and show that, while standards and standardization are typically associated with stability and sameness, they are essentially a dynamic phenomenon.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

The promise of efficient, low-cost, or ``neutral'' solutions harnessing the potential of big data has led public bodies to adopt algorithmic systems in the provision of public services. As AI algorithms have permeated high-stakes aspects of our public existence\textemdash from hiring and education decisions to the governmental use of enforcement powers (policing) or liberty-restricting decisions (bail and sentencing)\textemdash this necessarily raises important accountability questions: What accountability challenges do AI algorithmic systems bring with them, and how can we safeguard accountability in algorithmic decision-making? Drawing on a decidedly public administration perspective, and given the current challenges that have thus far become manifest in the field, we critically reflect on and map out in a conceptually guided manner the implications of these systems, and the limitations they pose, for public accountability.},

The leading example of a public, general-purpose open knowledge network (aka~knowledge graph) is Wikidata, which has demonstrated remarkable advances in quality and coverage over this time. Proprietary knowledge graphs drive some of the leading applications of the day including, for example, Google Search, Alexa, Siri, and Cortana. Open Knowledge Networks are exciting: they promise the power of structured database-like queries with the potential for the wide coverage that is today only provided by the Web. With the current state of the art, building, using, and scaling large knowledge networks can still be frustratingly slow. This article describes a National Science Foundation Convergence Accelerator project to build a set of Knowledge Network Programming Infrastructure systems to address this~issue.},

These are core concerns for researchers working within the area of critical information studies\textemdash yet these companies have also demonstrated novel tactics for obscuring their operations, reducing the ability of scholars to speak about how harms are perpetuated or to link them to larger systems. While scholars' methods and ethical conventions have historically privileged the agency of research participants, the current landscape suggests the value of exploring methods that would reveal actions that are purposefully hidden. We propose investigation as a model for critical information studies and review the methods and epistemological conventions of investigative journalists as a provocative example, noting that their orientation toward those in power enables them to discuss societal harms in ways that academic researchers often cannot. We conclude by discussing key topics, such as process accountability and institutional norms, that should feature in discussions of how academic researchers might position investigation in relation to their own work.},

  abstract = {Creating knowledge bases and ontologies is a time consuming task that relies on a manual curation. AI/NLP approaches can assist expert curators in populating these knowledge bases, but current approaches rely on extensive training data, and are not able to populate arbitrary complex nested knowledge schemas. Here we present Structured Prompt Interrogation and Recursive Extraction of Semantics (SPIRES), a Knowledge Extraction approach that relies on the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot learning (ZSL) and general-purpose query answering from flexible prompts and return information conforming to a specified schema. Given a detailed, user-defined knowledge schema and an input text, SPIRES recursively performs prompt interrogation against GPT-3+ to obtain a set of responses matching the provided schema. SPIRES uses existing ontologies and vocabularies to provide identifiers for all matched elements. We present examples of use of SPIRES in different domains, including extraction of food recipes, multi-species cellular signaling pathways, disease treatments, multi-step drug mechanisms, and chemical to disease causation graphs. Current SPIRES accuracy is comparable to the mid-range of existing Relation Extraction (RE) methods, but has the advantage of easy customization, flexibility, and, crucially, the ability to perform new tasks in the absence of any training data. This method supports a general strategy of leveraging the language interpreting capabilities of LLMs to assemble knowledge bases, assisting manual knowledge curation and acquisition while supporting validation with publicly-available databases and ontologies external to the LLM. SPIRES is available as part of the open source OntoGPT package: https://github.com/ monarch-initiative/ontogpt.},

The Freebase knowledge base was a major Semantic Web and linked data technology that was acquired by Google in 2010 to support the Google Knowledge Graph, the backend for Google search results that include structured answers to queries instead of a series of links to external resources. After its shutdown in 2016, Freebase is contained in a data dump of 1.9 billion Resource Description Format (RDF) triples. A recomposition of the Freebase ontology will be analyzed in relation to concepts and insights from the literature on classification by Bowker and Star. This paper will explore how the Freebase ontology is shaped by many of the forces that also shape classification systems through a deep dive into the ontology and a small correlational study. These findings will provide a glimpse into the proprietary blackbox Knowledge Graph and what is meant by Google's mission to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful".},

The digital platform can consolidate the consumer data with its existing data set from other services and use it for personalization in related markets. We develop a theoretical model to examine the impact of such mergers across the two markets that are related through a consumption synergy. The merger links the markets for data collection and data application, through which the digital platform can leverage its market power and hurt competitors in both markets. Personalization can lead to exploitation of some consumers in the market for data application. But insofar as competitors remain active, the merger increases total consumer surplus in both markets by intensifying competition. When the consumption synergy is large enough, the merger can result in monopolization of both markets, leading to further consumer harm when stand-alone competitors exit in the long run. Thus, there is a trade-off where potential dynamic costs can outweigh static benefits. We also discuss policy implications by considering various merger remedies.},

  abstract = {Life sciences researchers are under pressure to innovate faster than ever. Big data offer the promise of unlocking novel insights and accelerating breakthroughs. Ironically, although more data are available than ever, only a fraction is being integrated, understood, and analyzed. The challenge lies in harnessing volumes of data, integrating the data from hundreds of sources, and understanding their various formats. New technologies such as cognitive computing offer promise for addressing this challenge because cognitive solutions are specifically designed to integrate and analyze big datasets. Cognitive solutions can understand different types of data such as lab values in a structured database or the text of a scientific publication. Cognitive solutions are trained to understand technical, industry-specific content and use advanced reasoning, predictive modeling, and machine learning techniques to advance research faster. Watson, a cognitive computing technology, has been configured to support life sciences research. This version of Watson includes medical literature, patents, genomics, and chemical and pharmacological data that researchers would typically use in their work. Watson has also been developed with specific comprehension of scientific terminology so it can make novel connections in millions of pages of text. Watson has been applied to a few pilot studies in the areas of drug target identification and drug repurposing. The pilot results suggest that Watson can accelerate identification of novel drug candidates and novel drug targets by harnessing the potential of big data.},

More specifically, we investigate the opportunities to select personalized query expansion terms for web search using three different desktop oriented approaches: summarizing the entire desktop data, summarizing only the desktop documents relevant to each user query, and applying natural language processing techniques to extract dispersive lexical compounds from relevant desktop resources. Our experiments with the Google API showed at least the latter two techniques to produce a very strong improvement over current web search.},

  abstract = {MModern day voice-activated virtual assistants allow users to share and ask for information that could be considered as personal through different input modalities and devices. Using Google Assistant, this study examined if the differences in modality (i.e., voice vs. text) and device (i.e., smartphone vs. smart home device) affect user perceptions when users attempt to retrieve sensitive health information from voice assistants. Major findings from this study suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction significantly enhanced perceived social presence of the voice assistant, but only when the users solicited less sensitive health-related information. Furthermore, when individuals reported less privacy concerns, voice (vs. text) interaction elicited positive attitudes toward the voice assistant via increased social presence, but only in the low (vs. high) information sensitivity condition. Contrary to modality, the device difference did not exert any significant impact on the attitudes toward the voice assistant regardless of the sensitivity level of the health information being asked or the level of individuals' privacy concerns.},

  abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence techniques have shown tremendous potential as a decision support tool for government agencies. However, recent studies typically highlight the combination of large-scale datasets and high-performance computing technologies, which is frequently far away from the reality of many public agencies that still heavily rely on their legacy systems and labor-intensive practices. Using that non-ideal organizational and technical infrastructure, they have to face very complex problems and propose policy solutions. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are one of such problems. HABs have increasingly become a serious environmental issue in the United States. However, the rapid and sporadic growth of algae and the current standard relying on manual sampling weaken the agencies' response. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we attempt to bridge advanced AI technologies and current government practice by examining the potential of artificial intelligence by comparing the performance of linear probability, random forest, and deep neural network algorithms in predicting HABs with manual sampling data. By integrating manually-sampled HABs data with predictors from publicly-available datasets (land use, weather, and drought), we demonstrate that random forest and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms improve the specificity of the prediction, increasing the true negative rate. Albeit not ideal, we believe that this approach can benefit public agencies that are forced to respond to HABs with limited resources for investing in improving legacy systems. Accurate prediction with limited data could still be useful for certain government decisions, even when the mechanisms of causality are not totally clear. AI techniques have the potential to improve these predictive capabilities.},

  abstract = {With the recent increase in the interest of individuals in health, lifecare, and disease, hospital medical services have been shifting from a treatment focus to prevention and health management. The medical industry is creating additional services for health- and life-promotion programs. This change represents a medical-service paradigm shift due to the prolonged life expectancy, aging, lifestyle changes, and income increases, and consequently, the concept of the smart health service has emerged as a major issue. Due to smart health, the existing health-promotion medical services that typically have been operated by large hospitals have been developing into remote medical-treatment services where personal health records are used in small hospitals; moreover, a further expansion has been occurring in the direction of u-Healthcare in which health conditions are continuously monitored in the everyday lives of the users. However, as the amount of data is increasing and the medical-data complexity is intensifying, the limitations of the previous approaches are increasingly problematic; furthermore, since even the same disease can show different symptoms depending on the personal health conditions, lifestyle, and genome information, universal healthcare is not effective for some patients, and it can even generate severe side effects. Thus, research on the AI-based healthcare that is in the form of mining-based smart health, which is a convergence technology of the 4IR, is actively being carried out. Particularly, the introduction of various smart medical equipment for which healthcare big data and a running machine have been combined and the expansion of the distribution of smartphone wearable devices have led to innovations such as personalized diagnostic and treatment services and chronic-disease management and prevention services. In addition, various already launched applications allow users to check their own health conditions and receive the corresponding feedback in real time. Based on these innovations, the preparation of a way to determine a user's current health conditions, and to respond properly through contextual feedback in the case of unsound health conditions, is underway. However, since the previously made healthcare-related applications need to be linked to a wearable device, and they provide medical feedback to users based solely on specific biometric data, inaccurate information can be provided. In addition, the user interfaces of some healthcare applications are very complicated, causing user inconvenience regarding the attainment of desired information. Therefore, we propose a chatbot-based healthcare service with a knowledge base for cloud computing. The proposed method is a mobile health service in the form of a chatbot for the provision of fast treatment in response to accidents that may occur in everyday life, and also in response to changes of the conditions of patients with chronic diseases. A chatbot is an intelligent conversation platform that interacts with users via a chatting interface, and since its use can be facilitated by linkages with the major social network service messengers, general users can easily access and receive various health services. The proposed framework enables a smooth human\textendash robot interaction that supports the efficient implementation of the chatbot healthcare service. The design of the framework comprises the following four levels: data level, information level, knowledge level, and service level.},

While Google coined the term ``Knowledge Graph'' in 2012, there are also a few openly available knowledge graphs, with DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase being among the most prominent ones. Those graphs are often constructed from semi-structured knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or harvested from the web with a combination of statistical and linguistic methods. The result are large-scale knowledge graphs that try to make a good trade-off between completeness and correctness. In order to further increase the utility of such knowledge graphs, various refinement methods have been proposed, which try to infer and add missing knowledge to the graph, or identify erroneous pieces of information. In this article, we provide a survey of such knowledge graph refinement approaches, with a dual look at both the methods being proposed as well as the evaluation methodologies used.},

  abstract = {The World Wide Web has evolved drastically over the past decade \textendash{} and the proliferation of Web APIs has turned it into the middleware of choice for most distributed systems. The recent focus on hypermedia-driven APIs together with initiatives such as the Web of Things and Linked Data are now promoting and advancing the development of a new generation of dynamic, open, and long-lived systems on the Web. These systems require agent-based solutions to the point that Web researchers have started to build autonomous systems on their own. It is thus both timely and necessary to investigate and align the latest developments in Web research and multi-agent systems (MAS) research. In this paper, we analyze in hindsight the factors that hindered the widespread acceptance of early Web-based MAS. We argue that the answer lies equally in a lack of practical use cases as well as the premature development and alignment of Web and agent technologies. We then present our vision for a new generation of autonomous systems on the Web, which we call hypermedia MAS, together with the research opportunities and challenges they bring.},

  abstract = {Background: Efforts are underway to semantically integrate large biomedical knowledge graphs using common upper-level ontologies to federate graph-oriented application programming interfaces (APIs) to the data. However, federation poses several challenges, including query routing to appropriate knowledge sources, generation and evaluation of answer subsets, semantic merger of those answer subsets, and visualization and exploration of results. Objective: We aimed to develop an interactive environment for query, visualization, and deep exploration of federated knowledge graphs. Methods: We developed a biomedical query language and web application interphase\textemdash termed as Translator Query Language (TranQL)\textemdash to query semantically federated knowledge graphs and explore query results. TranQL uses the Biolink data model as an upper-level biomedical ontology and an API standard that has been adopted by the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium to specify a protocol for expressing a query as a graph of Biolink data elements compiled from statements in the TranQL query language. Queries are mapped to federated knowledge sources, and answers are merged into a knowledge graph, with mappings between the knowledge graph and specific elements of the query. The TranQL interactive web application includes a user interface to support user exploration of the federated knowledge graph. Results: We developed 2 real-world use cases to validate TranQL and address biomedical questions of relevance to translational science. The use cases posed questions that traversed 2 federated Translator API endpoints: Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES) and Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways (ROBOKOP). ICEES provides open access to observational clinical and environmental data, and ROBOKOP provides access to linked biomedical entities, such as ``gene,'' ``chemical substance,'' and ``disease,'' that are derived largely from curated public data sources. We successfully posed queries to TranQL that traversed these endpoints and retrieved answers that we visualized and evaluated. Conclusions: TranQL can be used to ask questions of relevance to translational science, rapidly obtain answers that require assertions from a federation of knowledge sources, and provide valuable insights for translational research and clinical practice.},

Frequently entities with no references in knowledge sources and conversation history are introduced into responses, thus hindering the flow of the conversation -- existing work attempt to overcome this issue by tweaking the training procedure or using a multi-step refining method. However, minimal effort is put into constructing an entity-level hallucination detection system, which would provide fine-grained signals that control fallacious content while generating responses. As a first step to address this issue, we dive deep to identify various modes of hallucination in KG-grounded chatbots through human feedback analysis. Secondly, we propose a series of perturbation strategies to create a synthetic dataset named FADE (FActual Dialogue Hallucination DEtection Dataset). Finally, we conduct comprehensive data analyses and create multiple baseline models for hallucination detection to compare against human-verified data and already established benchmarks.},

Dialoguing with the most up-to-date literature, we broaden our understanding of the ongoing process of platformization of the~research life cycle, proposing a taxonomy and a definition for scientific digital platforms. The evidence provided throughout the paper unveils that  (i) the changes (caused by platformization) in each of the phases of the research cycle are not at all linear and are not happening simultaneously; (ii) actors from different subsystem played important roles in the platformization of science; and, (iii) specific categories of platforms have consolidated themselves as infrastructures and certain scientific infrastructures have been platformed, although this varies by category.},

  abstract = {The Internet has transformed the manner in which information is exchanged and business is conducted, arguably more than any other communication development in the past century. Despite its wide reach and powerful global influence, it is a medium uncontrolled by any one centralized system, organization, or governing body, a reality that has given rise to all manner of free-speech issues and cybersecurity concerns. The conflicts surrounding Internet governance are the new spaces where political and economic power is unfolding in the twenty-first century.This all-important study by Laura DeNardis reveals the inner power structure already in place within the architectures and institutions of Internet governance. It provides a theoretical framework for Internet governance that takes into account the privatization of global power as well as the role of sovereign nations and international treaties. In addition, DeNardis explores what is at stake in open global controversies and stresses the responsibility of the public to actively engage in these debates, because Internet governance will ultimately determine Internet freedom.},

  abstract = {Entity-oriented search tasks heavily rely on exploiting unstructured and structured collections. Moreover, it is frequent for text corpora and knowledge bases to provide complementary views on a common topic. While, traditionally, the retrieval unit was the document, modern search engines have evolved to also retrieve entities and to provide direct answers to the information needs of the users. Cross-referencing information from heterogeneous sources has become fundamental, however a mismatch still exists between text-based and knowledge-based retrieval approaches. The former does not account for complex relations, while the latter does not properly support keyword-based queries and ranked retrieval. Graphs are a good solution to this problem, since they can be used to represent text, entities and their relations. In this survey, we examine text-based approaches and how they evolved to leverage entities and their relations in the retrieval process. We also cover multiple aspects of graph-based models for entity-oriented search, providing an overview on link analysis and exploring graph-based text representation and retrieval, leveraging knowledge graphs for document or entity retrieval, building entity graphs from text, using graph matching for querying with subgraphs, exploiting hypergraph-based representations, and ranking based on random walks on graphs. We close with a discussion on the topic and a view of the future to motivate the research of graph-based models for entity-oriented search, particularly as joint representation models for the generalization of retrieval tasks.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

In contrast to machine learning and deep learning, knowledge graphs do not require large amounts of (training) data and offer a bigger potential for a multitude of domains and problems. This article shows the application of knowledge graphs for the semantic description and management of data in a data lake, which improves the findability and reusability of data, and enables the automatic processing by algorithms. Since knowledge graphs contain both the data as well as its semantically described schema (ontology), they enable novel ontology-driven software architectures, in which the domain knowledge and business logic can completely reside on the knowledge graph level. This article further introduces such a use case: an ontology-driven frontend implementation, which is able to fully adapt itself based on the underlying knowledge graph schema and dynamically render information in the desired manner.},

This book takes a stand against a world that benefits some (including the authors, two white women) at the expense of others. It seeks to provide concrete steps for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work towards justice, and for feminists seeking to learn how their own work can carry over to the growing field of data science. It is addressed to professionals in all fields where data-driven decisions are being made, as well as to communities that want to better understand the data that surrounds them. It is written for everyone who seeks to better understand the charts and statistics that they encounter in their day-to-day lives, and for everyone who seeks to better communicate the significance of such charts and statistics to others. This is an example-driven book written with a broad audience of scholars, students, and practitioners in mind. It offers a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by the ideas associated with intersectional feminist thought"--},

  abstract = {This document has been developed by the Interoperability Task Force of the EOSC Executive Board FAIR Working Group, with participation from the Architecture WG. Achieving interoperability within EOSC is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose EOSC to provide added value for service users. In the context of the FAIR principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that ``research data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing''. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - EIF): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the EOSC IF components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from ERICs (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: ``every semantic artefact that is being maintained in EOSC must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams'', or ``Coarse-grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available'', etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of FAIR Digital Objects in the context of EOSC and a reference architecture for the EOSC Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA), identifying the main building blocks required.},

  abstract = {Recently, the term knowledge graph has been used frequently in research and business, usually in close association with Semantic Web technologies, linked data, large-scale data analytics and cloud computing. Its popularity is clearly influenced by the introduction of Google's Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a definition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google's Knowledge Graph, although no official documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a definition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and defining the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a definition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision.},

In this article, we present methods for enhancing the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph (MAKG), a recently published large-scale knowledge graph containing metadata about scientific publications and associated authors, venues, and affiliations. Based on a qualitative analysis of the MAKG, we address three aspects. First, we adopt and evaluate unsupervised approaches for large-scale author name disambiguation. Second, we develop and evaluate methods for tagging publications by their discipline and by keywords, facilitating enhanced search and recommendation of publications and associated entities. Third, we compute and evaluate embeddings for all 239 million publications, 243 million authors, 49,000 journals, and 16,000 conference entities in the MAKG based on several state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Finally, we provide statistics for the updated MAKG. Our final MAKG is publicly available at https://makg.org and can be used for the search or recommendation of scholarly entities, as well as enhanced scientific impact quantification.},

  abstract = {The Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES) provides regulatory-compliant open access to sensitive patient data that have been integrated with public exposures data. ICEES was designed initially to support dynamic cohort creation and bivariate contingency tests. The objective of the present study was to develop an open approach to support multivariate analyses using existing ICEES functionalities and abiding by all regulatory constraints. We first developed an open approach for generating a multivariate table that maintains contingencies between clinical and environmental variables using programmatic calls to the open ICEES application programming interface. We then applied the approach to data on a large cohort (N~=~22,365) of patients with asthma or related conditions and generated an eight-feature table. Due to regulatory constraints, data loss was incurred with the incorporation of each successive feature variable, from a starting sample size of N~=~22,365 to a final sample size of N~=~4,556 (20.4\%), but data loss was {$<$} 10\% until the addition of the final two feature variables. We then applied a generalized linear model to the subsequent dataset and focused on the impact of seven select feature variables on asthma exacerbations, defined as annual emergency department or inpatient visits for respiratory issues. We identified five feature variables\textemdash sex, race, obesity, prednisone, and airborne particulate exposure\textemdash as significant predictors of asthma exacerbations. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ICEES open multivariate analysis and conclude that, despite limitations, ICEES can provide a valuable resource for open multivariate analysis and can serve as an exemplar for regulatory-compliant informatic solutions to open patient data, with capabilities to explore the impact of environmental exposures on health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: The Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES) serves as an open-source, disease-agnostic, regulatory-compliant framework and approach for openly exposing and exploring clinical data that have been integrated at the patient level with a variety of environmental exposures data. ICEES is equipped with tools to support basic statistical exploration of the integrated data in a completely open manner. Objective: This study aims to further develop and apply ICEES as a novel tool for openly exposing and exploring integrated clinical and environmental data. We focus on an asthma use case. Methods: We queried the ICEES open application programming interface (OpenAPI) using a functionality that supports chi-square tests between feature variables and a primary outcome measure, with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ({$\alpha$}=.001). We focused on 2 primary outcomes that are indicative of asthma exacerbations: annual emergency department (ED) or inpatient visits for respiratory issues; and annual prescriptions for prednisone. Results: Of the 157,410 patients within the asthma cohort, 26,332 (16.73\%) had 1 or more annual ED or inpatient visits for respiratory issues, and 17,056 (10.84\%) had 1 or more annual prescriptions for prednisone. We found that close proximity to a major roadway or highway, exposure to high levels of particulate matter {$\leq$}2.5 {$\mu$}m (PM2.5) or ozone, female sex, Caucasian race, low residential density, lack of health insurance, and low household income were significantly associated with asthma exacerbations (P\&lt;.001). Asthma exacerbations did not vary by rural versus urban residence. Moreover, the results were largely consistent across outcome measures. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the open-source ICEES can be used to replicate and extend published findings on factors that influence asthma exacerbations. As a disease-agnostic, open-source approach for integrating, exposing, and exploring patient-level clinical and environmental exposures data, we believe that ICEES will have broad adoption by other institutions and application in environmental health and other biomedical fields.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to develop a novel, regulatory-compliant approach for openly exposing integrated clinical and environmental exposures data: the Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES).The driving clinical use case for research and development of ICEES was asthma, which is a common disease influenced by hundreds of genes and a plethora of environmental exposures, including exposures to airborne pollutants. We developed a pipeline for integrating clinical data on patients with asthma-like conditions with data on environmental exposures derived from multiple public data sources. The data were integrated at the patient and visit level and used to create de-identified, binned, ``integrated feature tables,'' which were then placed behind an OpenAPI.Our preliminary evaluation results demonstrate a relationship between exposure to high levels of particulate matter {$\leq$}2.5 \textmu m in diameter (PM2.5) and the frequency of emergency department or inpatient visits for respiratory issues. For example, 16.73\% of patients with average daily exposure to PM2.5 \&gt;9.62 \textmu g/m3 experienced 2 or more emergency department or inpatient visits for respiratory issues in year 2010 compared with 7.93\% of patients with lower exposures (n\,=\,23 093).The results validated our overall approach for openly exposing and sharing integrated clinical and environmental exposures data. We plan to iteratively refine and expand ICEES by including additional years of data, feature variables, and disease cohorts.We believe that ICEES will serve as a regulatory-compliant model and approach for promoting open access to and sharing of integrated clinical and environmental exposures data.},

However, the data are often siloed, disorganized, and not broadly accessible due to discipline-specific differences in terminology and representation. To address these challenges, the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium has developed and tested a pilot knowledge graph-based ``Translator'' system capable of integrating existing biomedical data sets and ``translating'' those data into insights intended to augment human reasoning and accelerate translational science. Having demonstrated feasibility of the Translator system, the Translator program has since moved into development, and the Translator Consortium has made significant progress in the research, design, and implementation of an operational system. Herein, we describe the current system's architecture, performance, and quality of results. We apply Translator to several real-world use cases developed in collaboration with subject-matter experts. Finally, we discuss the scientific and technical features of Translator and compare those features to other state-of-the-art, biomedical graph-based question-answering systems.},

The difference between a platform and an infrastructure is subject to debate. In this article, we use the concept of the darknet to describe how infrastructure tends toward being public with other things where platforms tend to private relations. The darknet reveals these relations negatively, as we discuss, by turning these media objects into that which they desire not to be. We analyze these negative relations through the concept of the parasite developed by Michel Serres. By following how darknets parasite both platforms and infrastructure, we suggest a need to develop new concepts to understand the diversity of relations now possible in a network society.},

  abstract = {Our socio-technical environment is becoming increasingly complex all the while we have less and less time for making decisions. The advent of computers in general and AI in particular has helped us to deal with complexity and time constraints. Virtually no industry and sector remains untouched by this development: The private sector, government, non-profits; manufacturing, advertisement, logistics, healthcare, defense; finance, compliance, customer care, human resources and many more. Why is it then that, I wonder, we still have very little satisficing solutions to our worlds most pressing problems as for example stated in the sustainable development goals: Climate change, poverty, sustainable cities and so forth. One reason for this, I believe, is grounded in the false trust in the abundance of data and ubiquity of computational power. More data and brute force doesnt necessarily mean better insights and thus decisions. Sustainable and robust decisions depend on our understanding why things happen and our ability to think in plausible futures. Causality and scenarios can be generated through the symbiosis of human brain ingenuity and computational simulations. This implies that humans embrace digitalization as an opportunity and invest in the further development of cognitive humanmachine interaction. I will suggest and critically discuss a framework for constructing and applying a computational decision support framework that furthers this vision. Technically the framework hinges on data fusion, simulation and insight generation. Successful application for decision-making, however, relies on consequent stakeholder integration, which requires building trust in a simulations underlying causal model from which openness to internalize insights in organizational decision making processes derives. I will present the concrete steps of building a computational simulation designed for decision support against the background of two case studies representing pressing social problems, along with the process of taking the client on this journey and how it helped her to improve business critical decisions and thus outcomes. The quintessence is as simple as it remains futuresque: Tomorrows successful organization represents itself and the environment it operates in in a form of holodeck, enabling it and its employees to play through and train for the future that will challenges us.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a plethora of high-profile scientific publications has been reporting about machine learning algorithms outperforming clinicians in medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The influence of technology on marketing communications is rising in both applications and value created. Artificial intelligence (AI) and, as a result, smart speakers are benefiting both brands and customers at many levels. In particular, AI opens up the possibility to establish human-like dialogs with customers and to advertise brands in a new and engaging way. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to understand why and how consumers would accept receiving advertising (ad) via AI-enabled devices such as smart speakers.                                         Design/methodology/approach               A total of 326 individuals participated in a study that explored the factors influencing ad acceptance in smart devices. A partial least squares-structural equation model technique was used to validate the results.                                         Findings               The findings show that customer acceptance of ads via smart assistants is influenced by smart assistant usefulness and hedonic motivations. However, privacy risk moderates the relationship between smart speaker ease of use and smart speaker usefulness.                                         Originality/value               This paper explores the main drivers of ad acceptance via smart speakers and goes beyond the existing knowledge of smart speaker acceptance to further explore how this can become an important channel for brands to communicate.                        ,                             Aceptaci\'on de la publicidad a trav\'es de altavoces inteligentes                                         Objetivo               La influencia de la tecnolog\'ia en las comunicaciones de marketing est\'a aumentando tanto en las aplicaciones desarrolladas como en el valor creado.

En particular, la IA abre la posibilidad de establecer di\'alogos similares a los humanos con los clientes y de publicitar las marcas de una manera nueva y atractiva. Por lo tanto, es necesario entender por qu\'e y c\'omo los consumidores aceptar\'ian recibir publicidad (anuncios) a trav\'es de dispositivos con IA, como los altavoces inteligentes.

  abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have led to exciting breakthroughs in speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, there have been few positive results of deep models on ad-hoc retrieval tasks. This is partially due to the fact that many important characteristics of the ad-hoc retrieval task have not been well addressed in deep models yet. Typically, the ad-hoc retrieval task is formalized as a matching problem between two pieces of text in existing work using deep models, and treated equivalent to many NLP tasks such as paraphrase identification, question answering and automatic conversation. However, we argue that the ad-hoc retrieval task is mainly about relevance matching while most NLP matching tasks concern semantic matching, and there are some fundamental differences between these two matching tasks. Successful relevance matching requires proper handling of the exact matching signals, query term importance, and diverse matching requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep relevance matching model (DRMM) for ad-hoc retrieval. Specifically, our model employs a joint deep architecture at the query term level for relevance matching. By using matching histogram mapping, a feed forward matching network, and a term gating network, we can effectively deal with the three relevance matching factors mentioned above. Experimental results on two representative benchmark collections show that our model can significantly outperform some well-known retrieval models as well as state-of-the-art deep matching models.},

NERQ is potentially useful in many applications in web search. The paper proposes taking a probabilistic approach to the task using query log data and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We consider contexts of a named entity (i.e., the remainders of the named entity in queries) as words of a document, and classes of the named entity as topics. The topic model is constructed by a novel and general learning method referred to as WS-LDA (Weakly Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which employs weakly supervised learning (rather than unsupervised learning) using partially labeled seed entities. Experimental results show that the proposed method based on WS-LDA can accurately perform NERQ, and outperform the baseline methods.},

  abstract = {Research regarding source orientation has demonstrated that when interacting with computers, people direct their communication toward and react toward the technology itself. Users perceive technology to be a source in human-machine communication (HMC). This study provides a new dimension to those findings with regard to source orientation with voice-based, mobile virtual assistants enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). In qualitative interviews regarding their conceptualizations of mobile conversational agents (Apple's Siri, Google Voice, Samsung S-Voice) and their perceptions of interactions with these specific technologies, some participants describe the agent they can hear but not see as a voice in the mobile phone (assistant as distinct entity) while others perceive the technology that they command to be the voice of the phone (assistant as the device). Therefore, congruent with existing research, users of mobile assistants orient toward a technology, instead of thinking they are interacting with a human, but, in contrast to existing research, attend to different technologies. When technologies possess a disembodied voice and are designed with various social cues and degrees of intelligence, the locus and nature of the digital interlocutor is not uniform in people's minds.},

In contrast to traditional 'schema-on-write' approaches such as data warehouses, data lakes are repositories storing raw data in its original formats and providing a common access interface. Despite the strong interest raised from both academia and industry, there is a large body of ambiguity regarding the definition, functions and available technologies for data lakes. A complete, coherent picture of data lake challenges and solutions is still missing. This survey reviews the development, architectures, and systems of data lakes. We provide a comprehensive overview of research questions for designing and building data lakes. We classify the existing approaches and systems based on their provided functions for data lakes, which makes this survey a useful technical reference for designing, implementing and deploying data lakes. We hope that the thorough comparison of existing solutions and the discussion of open research challenges in this survey will motivate the future development of data lake research and practice.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose a methodological outlook for historical platform studies to increase the prominence of platform historiography in the field and practice of web history and archiving. We discuss the challenges of social media archiving and the research opportunities for `platform' historiography by focusing on the distinctive characteristics of web-based social media `platforms'. Based on our review of the literature, we argue that it is critical to foreground how contemporary platforms serve multiple user groups beyond end users (e.g. developers, business, investors) and how they operate on multiple levels (e.g. interface, architecture, ecosystem). By attending to the multiple sides and layers of social media beyond their end users only, we can reconstruct histories of platforms, not only as social networks, but also as technical artefacts, business organisations, and more. A focus on the materiality of platforms introduces numerous underutilised archived web sources that present significant entry points and research opportunities for platform historiography. We assess the availability of these archived sources across the leading web archives. Our results show that despite the challenges of social media archiving, platforms' resources are in fact well-preserved if we look beyond their end-user interfaces. Drawing on illustrative examples, we discuss two sets of entry points and materials for platform historiography at length: first, for writing developer-side histories, and second, for business-side histories. We conclude with recommendations for platform historians and archiving practitioners and reflections on the future of platform historiography.},

  abstract = {In this big data era, knowledge becomes increasingly linked, along with the rapid growth in data volume. Connected knowledge is naturally represented and stored as knowledge graphs, which are of more and more importance for many frontier research areas such as machine intelligence. Effectively finding relations between entities in a large knowledge graph plays a key role in many knowledge graph applications, as the most valuable part of a knowledge graph is its rich connectedness, which captures rich information about the objects in the real world. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of real-world knowledge, finding semantically close relations by navigation in a large knowledge graph is very challenging. Canonical graph exploration methods inevitably result in combinatorial explosion especially when the paths connecting two entities are long: the search space is \$O(d\^l)\$O(dl), where \$d\$d is the average graph node degree and \$l\$l is the length of the path. In this paper, we will systematically study the semantic navigation problem for large knowledge graphs. Inspired by AlphaGo, which was overwhelmingly successful in the game Go, we designed an efficient semantic navigation method based on a well-tailored Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm with the unique characteristics of knowledge graphs considered. Extensive experiments on different real-life knowledge bases show that our method is not only effective but also very efficient.},

We define what elements the most popular web search engines use on their results pages (e.g., organic results, advertisements, shortcuts) and to which degree they are used for popular vs. rare queries. Therefore, we send 500 queries of both types to the major search engines Google, Yahoo, Live.com and Ask. We count how often the different elements are used by the individual engines. In total, our study is based on 42,758 elements. Findings include that search engines use quite different approaches to results pages composition and therefore, the user gets to see quite different results sets depending on the search engine and search query used. Organic results still play the major role in the results pages, but different shortcuts are of some importance, too. Regarding the frequency of certain host within the results sets, we find that all search engines show Wikipedia results quite often, while other hosts shown depend on the search engine used. Both Google and Yahoo prefer results from their own offerings (such as YouTube or Yahoo Answers). Since we used the .com interfaces of the search engines, results may not be valid for other country-specific interfaces.},

  abstract = {I argue that data-driven predictions work primarily as instruments for systematic extraction of discretionary power \textendash{} the practical capacity to make everyday decisions and define one's situation. This extractive relation reprises a long historical pattern, in which new methods of producing knowledge generate a redistribution of epistemic power: who declares what kind of truth about me, to count for what kinds of decisions? I argue that prediction as extraction of discretion is normal and fundamental to the technology, rather than isolated cases of bias or error. Synthesising critical observations across anthropology, history of technology and critical data studies, the paper demonstrates this dynamic in two contemporary domains: (1) crime and policing demonstrates how predictive systems are extractive by design. Rather than neutral models led astray by garbage data, pre-existing interests thoroughly shape how prediction conceives of its object, its measures, and most importantly, what it does not measure and in doing so devalues. (2) I then examine the prediction of productivity in the long tradition of extracting discretion as a means to extract labour power. Making human behaviour more predictable for the client of prediction (the manager, the corporation, the police officer) often means making life and work more unpredictable for the target of prediction (the employee, the applicant, the citizen).},

In order to make a contribution to the conversation, participants typically do more than just produce the right utterance at the right time; they coordinate the presentation and acceptance of their utterances until they have reached a sufficient level of mutual understanding to move on, a level defined by the grounding criterion . Recent interest in employing grounding for use in collaborative dialog systems has highlighted difficulties in rendering hitherto qualitative intuitions about grounding into formal terms. In this paper, we propose a formalization of grounding based on decision theory that captures key intuitions about the contribution model while providing an explicit method for determining the grounding criterion. We illustrate the formalization by reviewing interactions between a user and a prototype spoken dialog system called the Bayesian Receptionist .},

  abstract = {Knowledge-graph (KG) embeddings have emerged as a promise in addressing challenges faced by modern biomedical research, including the growing gap between therapeutic needs and available treatments. The popularity of KG embeddings in graph analytics is on the rise, due at least partially to the presumed semanticity of the learned embeddings. Unfortunately, the ability of a node neighborhood picked up by an embedding to capture the node's semantics may depend on the characteristics of the data. One of the reasons for this problem is that KG nodes can be promiscuous, that is, associated with a number of different relationships that are not unique or indicative of the properties of the nodes. To address the promiscuity challenge and the documented runtime-performance challenge in real-life KG embedding tools, we propose to use domain- and task-specific information to specify regular-expression pathways that define neighborhoods of KG nodes of interest. Our proposed CompactWalks framework uses these semantic subgraphs to enable meaningful compact walks in random-walk based KG embedding methods. We report the results of case studies for the task of determining which pharmaceutical drugs could treat the same diseases. The findings suggest that our CompactWalks approach has the potential to address the promiscuity and runtime-performance challenges in applying embedding tools to large-scale KGs in real life, in the biomedical domain and possibly beyond.},

  abstract = {The standardized identification of biomedical entities is a cornerstone of interoperability, reuse, and data integration in the life sciences. Several registries have been developed to catalog resources maintaining identifiers for biomedical entities such as small molecules, proteins, cell lines, and clinical trials. However, existing registries have struggled to provide sufficient coverage and metadata standards that meet the evolving needs of modern life sciences researchers. Here, we introduce the Bioregistry, an integrative, open, community-driven metaregistry that synthesizes and substantially expands upon 23 existing registries. The Bioregistry addresses the need for a sustainable registry by leveraging public infrastructure and automation, and employing a progressive governance model centered around open code and open data to foster community contribution. The Bioregistry can be used to support the standardized annotation of data, models, ontologies, and scientific literature, thereby promoting their interoperability and reuse. The Bioregistry can be accessed through https://bioregistry.ioand its source code and data are available under the MIT and CC0 Licenses at https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry.},

So far, it has been shown that current language models can learn symbolic query reformulation policies, in combination with traditional term-based retrieval, but fall short of outperforming neural retrievers. We extend the previous learning to search setup to a hybrid environment, which accepts discrete query refinement operations, after a first-pass retrieval step via a dual encoder. Experiments on the BEIR task show that search agents, trained via behavioral cloning, outperform the underlying search system based on a combined dual encoder retriever and cross encoder reranker. Furthermore, we find that simple heuristic Hybrid Retrieval Environments (HRE) can improve baseline performance by several nDCG points. The search agent based on HRE (HARE) matches state-of-the-art performance, balanced in both zero-shot and in-domain evaluations, via interpretable actions, and at twice the speed.},

By adopting OREOLM to RoBERTa and T5, we show significant performance gain, achieving stateof-art results in the Closed-Book setting.

  abstract = {We propose UniT, a Unified Transformer model to simultaneously learn the most prominent tasks across different domains, ranging from object detection to natural language understanding and multimodal reasoning. Based on the transformer encoder-decoder architecture, our UniT model encodes each input modality with an encoder and makes predictions on each task with a shared decoder over the encoded input representations, followed by task-specific output heads. The entire model is jointly trained end-to-end with losses from each task. Compared to previous efforts on multi-task learning with transformers, we share the same model parameters across all tasks instead of separately fine-tuning task-specific models and handle a much higher variety of tasks across different domains. In our experiments, we learn 7 tasks jointly over 8 datasets, achieving strong performance on each task with significantly fewer parameters. Our code is available in MMF at https://mmf.sh.},

  abstract = {This panel focuses on the way that platforms have become key players in the representation of knowledge. Recently, there have been calls to combine infrastructure and platform-based frameworks to understand the nature of information exchange on the web through digital tools for knowledge sharing. The present panel builds and extends work on platform and infrastructure studies in what has been referred to as ``knowledge as programmable object'' (Plantin, et al., 2018), specifically focusing on how metadata and semantic information are shaped and exchanged in specific web contexts. As Bucher (2012; 2013) and Helmond (2015) show, data portability in the context of web platforms requires a certain level of semantic annotation. Semantic interoperability is the defining feature of so-called "Web 3.0"\textemdash traditionally referred to as the semantic web (Antoniou et al, 2012; Szeredi et al, 2014). Since its inception, the semantic web has privileged the status of metadata for providing the fine-grained levels of contextual expressivity needed for machine-readable web data, and can be found in products as diverse as Google's Knowledge Graph, online research repositories like Figshare, and other sources that engage in platformizing knowledge. The first paper in this panel examines the international Schema.org collaboration. The second paper investigates the epistemological implications when platforms organize data sharing. The third paper argues for the use of patents to inform research methodologies for understanding knowledge graphs. The fourth paper discusses private platforms' extraction and collection of user metadata and the enclosure of data access.},

The company supplies information technology solutions for data integration and tracking to police and government agencies, humanitarian organizations, and corporations. To illuminate and learn more about Palantir's opaque surveillance practices, we begin by sketching Palantir's company history and contract network, followed by an explanation of key terms associated with Palantir's technology area and a description of the firm's platform ecosystem. We then summarize current scholarship on Palantir's continuing role in policing, intelligence, and security operations. Our primary contribution and analysis are a computational topic modeling of Palantir's surveillance patents (n\,=\,155), including their topics and themes. We end by discussing the concept of infrastructuring to understand Palantir as a surveillance platform, where we theorize information standards like administrative metadata as phenomena for structuring social worlds in and through access to digital information.},

Given their complementarity, their integration is desired. Yet, their different foci, modeling approaches, and sparse overlap make integration difficult. In this paper, we consolidate commonsense knowledge by following five principles, which we apply to combine seven key sources into a first integrated CommonSense Knowledge Graph (CSKG). We analyze CSKG and its various text and graph embeddings, showing that CSKG is well-connected and that its embeddings provide a useful entry point to the graph. We demonstrate how CSKG can provide evidence for generalizable downstream reasoning and for pre-training of language models. CSKG and all its embeddings are made publicly available to support further research on commonsense knowledge integration and reasoning.},

We argue that such biases, which would lead to a narrowing of the Web's functioning in society, run counter to the basic architecture of the Web as well as to the values and ideals that have fueled widespread support for its growth and development. We consider ways of addressing the politics of search engines, raising doubts whether, in particular, the market mechanism could serve as an acceptable corrective.},

While some of its services are seen as creators of a new informational economy and are hence publicly legitimized, other features are increasingly under surveillance and policed, although in reality the differences between these services is far from obvious. Our thesis is that we are currently experiencing a temporary postponement of the law, in the context of Web 2.0. Agamben's work on the state of exception is here used to theorize the informational economy as an ongoing dispossession, under the guise of `networked production'. This dispossession is seen as a parallel to the concept of `primitive accumulation', as a means of moving things from the exterior to the interior of the capitalist economy. This theory lets us problematize the concept of free labor, the metaphor of the enclosure, and puts into question the dichotomy between copyright and cultural commons.},

Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence.

We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\textendash environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as ``what is here,'' ``what happened here before,'' and ``how does this region compare to \ldots '' for any region on earth within seconds.},

  abstract = {Computational artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are increasingly used to support decision making by governments. Yet algorithms often remain opaque to the decision makers and devoid of clear explanations for the decisions made. In this study, we used an experimental approach to compare decision making in three situations: humans making decisions (1) without any support of algorithms, (2) supported by business rules (BR), and (3) supported by machine learning (ML). Participants were asked to make the correct decisions given various scenarios, while BR and ML algorithms could provide correct or incorrect suggestions to the decision maker. This enabled us to evaluate whether the participants were able to understand the limitations of BR and ML. The experiment shows that algorithms help decision makers to make more correct decisions. The findings suggest that explainable AI combined with experience helps them detect incorrect suggestions made by algorithms. However, even experienced persons were not able to identify all mistakes. Ensuring the ability to understand and traceback decisions are not sufficient for avoiding making incorrect decisions. The findings imply that algorithms should be adopted with care and that selecting the appropriate algorithms for supporting decisions and training of decision makers are key factors in increasing accountability and transparency.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the ethical implications of Google's Knowledge Graph. The paper argues that in the advent and implementation of said Knowledge Graph, the role of Google in users' lives and the power held by Google as the key intermediary of information must be scrutinized. Design/methodology/approach Revisiting existing literature on Google and its impact on knowledge culture, the paper seeks to assess whether the implementation of The Knowledge Graph represents a significant shift in the nature (or use) of the service. Findings The paper concludes that the extension to Google Search, The Knowledge Graph, can serve to radicalize Google's position as a key intermediary of information in users' lives. Rather than simply serving as a gatekeeper supplying the user with an array of links matching a given query, Google now conveniently disseminates information on their own site, roughly rendering the remainder of the web superfluous. Considering both the commercial nature and the opacity of the service, Google as a de facto solo editor of information is worrying from both a democratic and ethical perspective. A culture of emphatic insistence on convenience and consumption is likely to contribute to the impediment of autonomous information retrieval and digital literacy. Research limitations/implications The paper must be considered a preliminary inquiry into Google's reliability as an editor of the body of knowledge. As of yet, no literature specifically has remarked on The Knowledge Graph. Originality/value This paper examines whether the newest extension of Google Search, The Knowledge Graph, poses any significant changes to the assessment of the service and its role in the culture. Fostering critical, digital literacy in search engine users is deemed of even more vital importance to society with the implementation of The Knowledge Graph. This paper, preliminary and far from exhaustive, seeks to initiate a discussion on the future responsibilities of Google, scholars and users in securing the ideal of critical digital literacy.},

  abstract = {Digital artifacts are embedded in wider and constantly shifting ecosystems such that they become increasingly editable, interactive, reprogrammable, and distributable. This state of flux and constant transfiguration renders the value and utility of these artifacts contingent on shifting webs of functional relations with other artifacts across specific contexts and organizations. By the same token, it apportions control over the development and use of these artifacts over a range of dispersed stakeholders and makes their management a complex technical and social undertaking. These ideas are illustrated with reference to (1) provenance and authenticity of digital documents within the overall context of archiving and social memory and (2) the content dynamics occasioned by the findability of content mediated by Internet search engines. We conclude that the steady change and transfiguration of digital artifacts signal a shift of epochal dimensions that calls for rethinking some of the inherited wisdom in IS research and practice.},

As digital objects diffuse throughout the institutional fabric, these attributes and the information-based operations and procedures out of which they are sustained install themselves at the heart of social practice. The entities and processes that constitute the stuff of social practice are thereby rendered increasingly unstable and transfigurable, producing a context of experience in which the certainties of recurring and recognizable objects are on the wane. These claims are supported with reference to 1) the elusive identity of digital documents and the problems of authentication/preservation of records such an identity posits and 2) the operations of search engines and the effects digital search has on the content of the documents it retrieves.},

First, we measure the extent to which platforms are insinuating themselves into the economy. We accomplish this by analyzing the presence of platforms as intermediating organizations across all US service industries at the six-digit North American Industry Classification System code level. Our results show that 70\% of service industries, representing over 5.2 million establishments, are potentially affected by one or more platforms. Secondly, we undertake a detailed firm-level case study of the mega-platform, Amazon, which demonstrates the ways that the aforementioned macro-level data is expressed by a single platform firm. This case study shows that Amazon's growth trajectory has resulted in it entering and transforming existing industries and sectors. We conclude by reflecting upon the limitations and implications for future research.},

We start with ``goo goos and gaa gaas,'' then on to baby sign language, a few simple words like ``momma,'' and our conversations get more complex from there.For the Google Assistant to have a natural conversation, it should be able to understand when it's being spoken to and should be capable of responding to several requests during an interaction. We're taking another step forward in making your interactions with the Google Assistant more natural with Continued Conversation, available starting today on Google Home, Google Home Mini and Google Home Max.We've heard from a lot of people that adding ``Hey Google'' before each follow-up question for the Assistant doesn't feel as natural as they'd like. We announced Continued Conversation at I/O as an optional setting which lets you have a natural back-and-forth conversation with the Assistant without repeating ``Hey Google'' for each follow-up request. The new feature is starting to roll out today, and you can turn it on in the Google Assistant app by going to Settings \textrightarrow{} Preferences \textrightarrow{} Continued Conversation and hitting the toggle.With Continued Conversation turned on, after you ask the Assistant a question, you can ask a follow-up, set a reminder, or add something to your shopping list without having to say ``Hey Google'' each time. You can say ``thank you'' or ``stop'' once you're done, or we'll end the conversation once we detect that you're no longer talking to the Assistant. You'll still need to activate your Assistant devices with ``Ok Google,'' ``Hey Google,'' or with a physical trigger, but with this new optional setting turned on, the Assistant will stay active for long enough to respond to follow up questions so you don't have to say ``Hey Google'' as often.So next time you wake up and the skies are grey, just ask ``Hey Google, what's the weather today?''... ``And what about tomorrow?''... ``Can you add a rain jacket to my shopping list''... ``And remind me to bring an umbrella tomorrow morning''...``Thank you!''},

We illustrate the concept with COP examples both for primary and alternative (i.e., drug repurposing) therapeutic applications.

We propose that broader use of COP uncovered with the help of biomedical knowledge graph mining will likely accelerate drug discovery and repurposing efforts.},

  abstract = {"In our digital world, data is power, and information hoarders reign supreme. The practices of these digital pillagers are analogous to those of cartels--they use intimidation, aggression, and force to maintain control and power. Sarah Lamdan brings us into the unregulated underworld of the "data cartels," demonstrating how the entities mining, hoarding, commodifying, and selling our data and informational resources perpetuate social inequalities and threaten the democratic sharing of knowledge. The companies at the center of this book are not household names like Google. They fly under the radar and self-identify as "data analytics" or "business solutions" operations. These companies supply the digital lifeblood that flow through the circulatory system of the internet. With their control over data, they can prevent the free flow of information to places where it is needed, and simultaneously distribute private information to predatory entities. Just a few companies dominate most of our critical informational resources, from scientific research and financial data to the law. They are also data brokers, selling our personal data to law enforcement and other government agencies that determine whether we should be eligible for social services, and they sell "risk" products that insurance companies, employers, landlords, and healthcare systems use to make decisions. Alarmingly, everything they're doing is perfectly legal. Ranging from small information firms to billion-dollar data giants like Thomson Reuters and RELX Group, these companies masterfully exploit outdated information and privacy laws, curating online information in a way that amplifies digital racism and targets marginalized communities. In this book, Lamdan contends that privatization and tech exceptionalism have prevented us from creating effective legal regulation. Lack of legal intervention has allowed oversized information oligopolies to coalesce. In addition to specific legal and market-based solutions, Lamdan calls for treating information like a public good and creating digital infrastructure that supports our democratic ideals"--},

  abstract = {In this work, we aim to capitalize on the unique few-shot capabilities of large-scale language models (LSLMs) to overcome some of their challenges with respect to grounding to factual and up-to-date information. Motivated by semi-parametric language models (LMs), which ground their decisions in external retrieved evidence, we use few-shot prompting to learn to condition LMs on information returned from the web using Google Search, a broad and constantly updated knowledge source. Our approach does not involve fine-tuning or learning additional parameters, thus making it applicable to any LM, offering therefore a strong baseline. Indeed, we find that LMs conditioned on the web surpass performance of closed-book models of similar, or even larger, model sizes in open-domain question answering. Finally, we find that increasing the inference-time compute of models, achieved via using multiple retrieved evidences to generate multiple answers followed by a reranking stage that uses scores generated by the same LMs, leads to better performance and alleviates lower performance of smaller few-shot LMs. All in all, our findings suggest that it might be beneficial to slow down the race towards the biggest model and instead shift attention towards finding more effective ways to use models, including but not limited to, better prompting or increasing inference-time compute.},

Yet, it is getting harder, even for subject matter experts, to quickly identify quality, trustworthy, and reliable content available online through search engines powered by advanced knowledge graphs. This paper explores the practical applications of Domain Specific Knowledge Graphs that allow for the extraction of information from trusted published and unpublished sources, to map the extracted information to an ontology defined in collaboration with sector experts, and to enable the public to go from single queries into ongoing conversations meeting their knowledge needs reliably. We focused on Social-Impact Funding, an area of need for over one million nonprofit organizations, foundations, government entities, social entrepreneurs, impact investors, and academic institutions in the US.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of information and communication technologies has enabled a value co-creation paradigm for developing industrial products and services, where massive heterogeneous data and multidisciplinary knowledge are generated and leveraged. In this context, Knowledge Graph (KG) emerges as a promising tool to elicit, fuse, process, and utilize numerous entities and relationships embedded in products and services, as well as their stakeholders. Nevertheless, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is scarcely any comprehensive and thorough discussion about making full use of KG's potentials to solve pain points of product development and service innovation in the industry. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper conducted a systematic survey of KG exploitations in industrial products and services and the customizations towards higher adaptability to practices. The authors selected 119 representative papers (up to 10/03/2021) together with other 29 supplementary works to summarize the technical and practical efforts and discuss the current challenges of exploiting KG in industrial products and services. Meantime, this work also highlights enhancing KG's availability and boosting its productivity in industrial products and services development as the core future perspectives to explore. It is hoped that this work can provide a basis for the explorations and implementations of KG-supported industrial product and services development, and attract more open discussions to the exploitation of KG-enabled industrial information systems.},

  abstract = {The growing carbon footprint of artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large ones such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, has been undergoing public scrutiny. Unfortunately, however, the equally important and enormous water footprint of AI models has remained under the radar. For example, training GPT-3 in Microsoft's state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly consume 700,000 liters of clean freshwater (enough for producing 370 BMW cars or 320 Tesla electric vehicles) and the water consumption would have been tripled if training were done in Microsoft's Asian data centers, but such information has been kept as a secret. This is extremely concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting water resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, AI models can, and also should, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing their own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate fine-grained water footprint of AI models, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of AI models' runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable AI.},

However, as people get more familiar with voice assistants, they may increase their expectations for more complex tasks, such as exploratory search --- e.g., "What should I do when I visit Paris with kids? Oh, and ideally not too expensive." Compared to simple search tasks such as "How tall is the Eiffel Tower?", which can be answered with a single-shot answer, the response to exploratory search is more nuanced, especially through voice-based assistants. In this paper, we outline four challenges in designing voice assistants that can better support exploratory search: addressing situationally induced impairments; working with mixed-modal interactions; designing for diverse populations; and meeting users' expectations and gaining their trust. Addressing these challenges is important for developing more "intelligent" voice-based personal assistants.},

Drawing on critical theory it shows how capitalist value-systems manifest in search technology, how they spread through algorithmic logics and how they are stabilized in society. Following philosophers like Althusser, Marx and Gramsci it elaborates how content providers and users contribute to Google's capital accumulation cycle and exploitation schemes that come along with it. In line with contemporary mass media and neoliberal politics they appear to be fostering capitalism and its ``commodity fetishism'' (Marx). It further reveals that the capitalist hegemony has to be constantly negotiated and renewed. This dynamic notion of ideology opens up the view for moments of struggle and counter-actions. ``Organic intellectuals'' (Gramsci) can play a central role in challenging powerful actors like Google and their algorithmic ideology. To pave the way towards more democratic information technology, however, requires more than single organic intellectuals. Additional obstacles need to be conquered, as I finally discuss.},

ShopTalk decouples dialog management from fulfillment, thereby allowing the dialog understanding system to be domain-agnostic and not tied to the particular shopping application. The dialog understanding system consists of a deep-learned Contextual Language Understanding module, which interprets user utterances, and a primarily rules-based Dialog-State Tracker (DST), which updates the dialog state and formulates search requests intended for the fulfillment engine. The interface between the two modules consists of a minimal set of domain-agnostic "intent operators," which instruct the DST on how to update the dialog state. ShopTalk was deployed in 2020 on the Google Assistant for Shopping searches.},

Applications access data in users' pods using well defined protocols, and a decentralized authentication and access control mechanism guarantees the privacy of the data. In this decentralized architecture, applications can operate on users' data wherever it is stored. Users control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. We will demonstrate the utility of Solid and how it is experienced from the point of view of end users and application developers. For this, we will use a set of Solid servers and multiple Web applications that use these servers.

  abstract = {Color coded terror alerts, invasion, drone war, rampant surveillance: all manifestations of the type of new power Brian Massumi theorizes in Ontopower. Through an in-depth examination of the War on Terror and the culture of crisis, Massumi identifies the emergence of preemption, which he characterizes as the operative logic of our time. Security threats, regardless of the existence of credible intelligence, are now felt into reality. Whereas nations once waited for a clear and present danger to emerge before using force, a threat's felt reality now demands launching a preemptive strike. Power refocuses on what may emerge, as that potential presents itself to feeling. This affective logic of potential washes back from the war front to become the dominant mode of power on the home front as well. This is ontopower-the mode of power embodying the logic of preemption across the full spectrum of force, from the "hard" (military intervention) to the "soft" (surveillance). With Ontopower, Massumi provides an original theory of power that explains not only current practices of war but the culture of insecurity permeating our contemporary neoliberal condition.},

  abstract = {The web of linked data, otherwise known as the semantic web, is a system in which information is structured and interlinked to provide meaningful content to artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. As the complex interactions between digital personae and these algorithms mediate access to information, it becomes necessary to understand how these classification and knowledge systems are developed. What are the processes by which those systems come to represent the world, and how are the controversies that arise in their creation, overcome? As a global form, the semantic web is an assemblage of many interlinked classification and knowledge systems, which are themselves assemblages. Through the perspectives of global assemblage theory, critical code studies and practice theory, I analyse netnographic data of one such assemblage. Schema.org is but one component of the larger global assemblage of the semantic web, and as such is an emergent articulation of different knowledges, interests and networks of actors. This articulation comes together to tame the profusion of things, seeking stability in representation, but in the process, it faces and produces more instability. Furthermore, this production of instability contributes to the emergence of new assemblages that have similar aims.},

  abstract = {When experiencing an information need, users want to engage with a domain expert, but often turn to an information retrieval system, such as a search engine, instead. Classical information retrieval systems do not answer information needs directly, but instead provide references to (hopefully authoritative) answers. Successful question answering systems offer a limited corpus created on-demand by human experts, which is neither timely nor scalable. Pre-trained language models, by contrast, are capable of directly generating prose that may be responsive to an information need, but at present they are dilettantes rather than domain experts -- they do not have a true understanding of the world, they are prone to hallucinating, and crucially they are incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting documents in the corpus they were trained over. This paper examines how ideas from classical information retrieval and pre-trained language models can be synthesized and evolved into systems that truly deliver on the promise of domain expert advice.},

  abstract = {This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.},

  abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the human race has gradually become a norm. AI entails technology assemblages such as machine learning, natural language processing, and reasoning. The influence of AI systems has intensified in consumers' daily lives. Many consumers have interacted with the notions of AI through advertisements or having personal experiences. Many consumers are curious about the use of AI. This paper reports three studies conducted to determine whether anthropomorphism (ANTH) and engagement play a role in consumers' intention to re-use a voice assistant (VA; a machine-learning AI). The second study will determine if ANTH and engagement play a role when consumers are using the VAs for different activities (task completion vs. information gathering). In addition, in Study 2, actual re-use behavior was also tested in the model, which encouraged a stronger overall model fit. The results show that in general effort expectation (EE) has a strong positive impact on consumers' usage experience of the VA. However, between the two types of activities, EE has a stronger impact on consumers' usage experience for information-gathering activities, whereas performance expectation has a stronger impact on usage experience when consumers use the VA for task-completion purposes. The third study used internet usage experience as a moderating variable to determine the boundaries of the mediating effects in the study. The results show that the mediators yield results similar to prior studies.},

SPOKE contains 27 million nodes of 21 different types and 53 million edges of 55 types downloaded from 41 databases. The graph is built on the framework of 11 ontologies that maintain its structure, enable mappings and facilitate navigation. SPOKE is built weekly by python scripts which download each resource, check for integrity and completeness, and then create a `parent table' of nodes and edges. Graph queries are translated by a REST API and users can submit searches directly via an API or a graphical user interface.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The development of web 2.0 was powered by web services that are software systems designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It was the choice of standards enabling such interactions that favored communication among different systems and their mash ups. Facebook was the first social networking site to launch a service for developers that exposed its web services and the correlated APIs (application programming interfaces). This choice allowed programmers to create tools that could live within Facebook and turned the social networking site into a platform by enacting its programmability. In order to investigate the possibilities and the constraints offered by social media platforms, there seems to arise the necessity to integrate the analysis of frontend texts (such as posts or comments) and of social media communicative properties with the exploration of an underlying layer constituted by the network of relationships created within an application ecosystem and developed by using web services. The aim of the paper is to present a multi-layered approach to the study of social media platforms that combines the emerging subfield of Semiotic Technology with Platform Studies. The model is here applied to the analysis of Facebook Login Service.},

The extant cloud computing literature reports specific ethical perspectives on focussed topics in this domain, but does not explicitly refer to a specific ethical conception or reference point. This chapter provides an overview of ethics and ethical theories, which can be used to analyse the use of cloud technology and the complex multi-stakeholder structure of the industry. It is critical that cloud providers and users recognise that they effectively shape the morality of the cloud computing context through their interactions with other providers and users, and with the platform itself. Both stakeholder sets must be accountable for the possibilities offered by the technology. While pertinent regulation is continuously evolving, it is unlikely to advance at a similar rapid pace to that of innovation in the cloud computing industry. It is therefore essential that ethics is carefully considered to orient cloud computing towards the good of society.},

  abstract = {Objective Early identification of chronic diseases is a pillar of precision medicine as it can lead to improved outcomes, reduction of disease burden, and lower healthcare costs. Predictions of a patient's health trajectory have been improved through the application of machine learning approaches to electronic health records (EHRs). However, these methods have traditionally relied on ``black box'' algorithms that can process large amounts of data but are unable to incorporate domain knowledge, thus limiting their predictive and explanatory power. Here, we present a method for incorporating domain knowledge into clinical classifications by embedding individual patient data into a biomedical knowledge graph. Materials and Methods A modified version of the Page rank algorithm was implemented to embed millions of deidentified EHRs into a biomedical knowledge graph (SPOKE). This resulted in high-dimensional, knowledge-guided patient health signatures (ie, SPOKEsigs) that were subsequently used as features in a random forest environment to classify patients at risk of developing a chronic disease. Results Our model predicted disease status of 5752 subjects 3 years before being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) (AUC = 0.83). SPOKEsigs outperformed predictions using EHRs alone, and the biological drivers of the classifiers provided insight into the underpinnings of prodromal MS. Conclusion Using data from EHR as input, SPOKEsigs describe patients at both the clinical and biological levels. We provide a clinical use case for detecting MS up to 5 years prior to their documented diagnosis in the clinic and illustrate the biological features that distinguish the prodromal MS state.},

Although data collected from biomedical research is expanding at an almost exponential rate, our ability to transform that information into patient care has not kept at pace. A major barrier preventing this transformation is that multi-dimensional data collection and analysis is usually carried out without much understanding of the underlying knowledge structure. Here, in an effort to bridge this gap, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of individual patients are connected to a heterogeneous knowledge network called Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE). Then an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm creates Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) that encode the importance of each SPOKE node for any code in the EHRs. We argue that these results, alongside the natural integration of PSEVs into any EHR machine-learning platform, provide a key step toward precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) predictive surveillance platforms were designed for\textemdash and funded by\textemdash law enforcement agencies. PDMPs use proprietary algorithms to determine a patient's risk for prescription drug misuse, diversion, and overdose. The proxies that PDMPs utilize to calculate patient risk scores likely produce artificially inflated scores for marginalized patients, including women and racial minorities with complex, pain-related conditions; poor, uninsured, under-insured, and rural individuals; and patients with co-morbid disabilities or diseases, including substance use disorder and mental health conditions.Law enforcement conducts dragnet sweeps of PDMP data to target providers that the platform characterizes as ``overprescribers'' and patients that it deems as high risk of drug diversion, misuse, and overdose. Research demonstrates that PDMP risk scoring coerces clinicians to force medication tapering, discontinue prescriptions, and even abandon patients without regard for the catastrophic collateral consequences that attend to those treatment decisions. PDMPs, therefore, have the potential to exacerbate discrimination against patients with complex and stigmatized medical conditions by generating flawed, short-cut assessment tools that incentivize providers to deny these patients indicated treatment.The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is authorized to regulate PDMP predictive diagnostic software platforms as medical devices, and the agency recently issued guidance that provides a framework for such oversight. Thus far, however, the FDA has failed to regulate PDMP platforms. This Article contends that the FDA should exercise its regulatory authority over PDMP risk scoring software to ensure that such predictive diagnostic tools are safe and effective for patients.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.},

  abstract = {To craft effective public policy, modern governments must gather and analyze data on both the performance of their public functions and the responses by the public. Federal administrative agencies such as the Patent Office and Centers for Disease Control routinely do this, as does the United States Congress. More importantly, they make such data freely accessible. Within the United States government, however, the judicial branch is a conspicuous outlier. In theory, federal court records could be used to evaluate the efficiency and fairness of the justice system. In practice, court records are effectively out of reach because they sit behind a government paywall. This financial barrier, along with an equally important myriad of technical obstacles, have forestalled the development of AI-driven analysis that could enable a systematic understanding and evaluation of the work of the courts. The Systematic Content Analysis of Litigation EventS Open Knowledge Network (SCALES OKN) seeks to address this situation by transforming the transparency and accessibility of court records. The SCALES OKN will potentiate the development of new AI solutions that will benefit the judiciary, legal scholars, and the public. In this article, we outline some of key financial, technical, and policy challenges to developing novel AI solutions.},

  abstract = {The recognition of names and their associated categories within unstructured text traditionally relies on semantic lexicons and gazetteers. The amount of effort required to assemble large lexicons confines the recognition to either a limited domain (e.g., \emph{medical imaging}), or a small set of pre-defined, broader categories of interest (e.g., \emph{persons}, \emph{countries}, \emph{organizations}, \emph{products}). This constitutes a serious limitation in an information seeking context. In this case, the categories of potential interest to users are more diverse (\emph{universities}, \emph{agencies}, \emph{retailers}, \emph{celebrities}), often refined (e.g., \emph{SLR digital cameras}, \emph{programming languages}, \emph{multinational oil companies}), and usually overlapping (e.g., the same entity may be concurrently a \emph{brand name}, a \emph{technology company}, and an \emph{industry leader}). We present a lightly supervised method for acquiring named entities in arbitrary categories. The method applies lightweight lexico-syntactic extraction patterns to the unstructured text of Web documents. The method is a departure from traditional approaches to named entity recognition in that: 1) it does not require any start-up seed names or training; 2) it does not encode any domain knowledge in its extraction patterns; 3) it is only lightly supervised, and data-driven; 4) it does not impose any a-priori restriction on the categories of extracted names. We illustrate applications of the method in Web search, and describe experiments on 500 million Web documents and news articles.},

The access to billions of binary relations among named entities would enable new search paradigms and alternative methods for presenting the search results. A first concrete step towards building large searchable repositories of factual knowledge is to derive such knowledge automatically at large scale from textual documents. Generalized contextual extraction patterns allow for fast iterative progression towards extracting one million facts of a given type (e.g., Person-BornIn-Year) from 100 million Web documents of arbitrary quality. The extraction starts from as few as 10 seed facts, requires no additional input knowledge or annotated text, and emphasizes scale and coverage by avoiding the use of syntactic parsers, named entity recognizers, gazetteers, and similar text processing tools and resources.},

This infrastructural turn assumes greater significance in relation to digital media and in particular, the influence that digital platforms have come to wield. Having `disrupted' many sectors of social, political, and economic life, many of the most widely used digital platforms now seem to operate as infrastructures themselves. This special issue explores how an infrastructural perspective reframes the study of digital platforms and allows us to pose questions of scale, labor, industry logics, policy and regulation, state power, cultural practices, and citizenship in relation to the routine, everyday uses of digital platforms. In this opening article, we offer a critical overview of media infrastructure studies and situate the study of digital infrastructures and platforms within broader scholarly and public debates on the history and political economy of media infrastructures. We also draw on the study of media industries and production cultures to make the case for an inter-medial and inter-sectoral approach to understanding the entanglements of digital platforms and infrastructures.},

We use case studies of the Open Web, Facebook, and Google to demonstrate that infrastructure studies provides a valuable approach to the evolution of shared, widely accessible systems and services of the type often provided or regulated by governments in the public interest. On the other hand, platform studies captures how communication and expression are both enabled and constrained by new digital systems and new media. In these environments, platform-based services acquire characteristics of infrastructure, while both new and existing infrastructures are built or reorganized on the logic of platforms. We conclude by underlining the potential of this combined framework for future case studies.},

Analysis It examines debates over best practices in semiotic infrastructure design, such as how much complexity adopted languages should characterize versus how restrictive they should be. It also discusses political and pragmatic considerations that impact what and how information is represented in an information system. Conclusion and implications This article suggests that all databased representations are forms of data power, and that examining semiotic infrastructure design provides insight into how culturally informed conceptions of difference structure how we access knowledge about our social and material worlds.},

As a cultural anthropologist, I approach this study with qualitative historical and ethnographic methodologies, positioning the community of researchers that have been involved in the design and implementation of Semantic Web protocols and technologies as my primary field site. Two concepts from Science and Technology Studies are introduced - thought styles and design logics. The paper demonstrates how diverse thinking about how to approach knowledge representation on the Web is rooted in debates that emerged in artificial intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s. It then goes on to discuss how the diverse approaches to Web semantics that emerged from these legacies have cultural and political implications. The paper concludes with a call for further research that positions Web architectures as objects of social and cultural study.},

  abstract = {Numerous statements and pamphlets indicate that governments should increase the transparency of ICTimplementations and algorithms in eGovernment services and should encourage democratic control. This paper presents research among civil servants, suppliers and experts who play a role in the automation of spatial policymaking and planning (e.g. environment, building, sound and CO2 regulation, mobility). The case is a major digitalisation programme of that spatial planning in the Netherlands. In this digital transition, the research assumption is that public and political values such as transparency, legitimacy and (perceived) fairness are difficult to validate in the practice of the design process; policy makers tend to lose sight of the algorithms and decision trees designed during the ICT -implementation of eGovernment services. This situation would implicate a power shift towards the system level bureaucrat. i.e., the digitized execution of laws and regulations, thereby threatening democratic control. This also sets the stage for anxiety towards ICT projects and digital bureaucracies. We have investigated perceptions about `validation dark spots' in the design process of the national planning platform that create unintended shifts in decision power in the context of the legal planning process. To identify these validation dark spots, 22 stakeholders were interviewed. The results partially confirm the assumption. Based on the collected data, nine validation dark spots are identified that require more attention and research.},

  abstract = {It is often desirable to model multiple objectives in real-world web applications, such as user satisfaction and user engagement in recommender systems. Multi-task learning has become the standard approach for such applications recently. While most of the multi-task recommendation model architectures proposed to date are focusing on using non-sequential input features (e.g., query and context), input data is often sequential in real-world web application scenarios. For example, user behavior streams, such as user search logs in search systems, are naturally atemporal sequence. Modeling user sequential behaviors as explicit sequential representations can empower the multi-task model to incorporate temporal dependencies, thus predicting future user behavior more accurately. Furthermore, user activity streams can come from heterogeneous data sources, such as user search logs and user browsing logs. They typically possess very different properties such as data sparsity and thus need careful treatment when being modeled jointly. In this work, we study the challenging problem of how to model sequential user behavior in the neural multi-task learning settings. Our major contribution is a novel framework, Mixture of Sequential Experts (MoSE). It explicitly models sequential user behavior using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in the state-of-art Multi-gate Mixture-of-Expert multi-task modeling framework. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of the MoSE architecture over seven alternative architectures on both synthetic and noisy real-world user data in G Suite. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the MoSE architecture in a real-world decision making engine in GMail that involves millions of users, balancing between search quality and resource costs.},

In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

  abstract = {The Decentralised Web (DW) has recently seen a renewed momentum, with a number of DW platforms like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Hubzilla gaining increasing traction. These offer alternatives to traditional social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, by enabling the operation of web infrastructure and services without centralised ownership or control. Although their services differ greatly, modern DW platforms mostly rely on two key innovations: first, their open source software allows anybody to setup independent servers ("instances") that people can sign-up to and use within a local community; and second, they build on top of federation protocols so that instances can mesh together, in a peer-to-peer fashion, to offer a globally integrated platform. In this paper, we present a measurement-driven exploration of these two innovations, using a popular DW microblogging platform (Mastodon) as a case study. We focus on identifying key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to decentralise the web, and empirically highlight a number of properties that are creating natural pressures towards re-centralisation. Finally, our measurements shed light on the behaviour of both administrators (i.e., people setting up instances) and regular users who sign-up to the platforms, also discussing a few techniques that may address some of the issues observed.},

Electronic health record (EHR) structure and language can exacerbate the harm they experience by using transphobic terminology, emphasizing binary genders, and pathologizing transness. Here, we investigate the ways in which SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM record gender-related terminology and explore their shortcomings as they contribute to this EHR-mediated violence. We discuss how this ``standardized'' gender-related medical terminology pathologizes transness, fails to accommodate nonbinary patients, and uses derogatory and outmoded language. We conclude that there is no easy fix to the transphobia beleaguering healthcare, provide options to reduce harm to patients, and ultimately call for a critical examination of medicine's role in transphobia. We aim to demonstrate the ways in which the [mis]use and [mis]understanding of gender-specific terminology in healthcare settings has harmed and continues to harm trans people by grounding our discussion in our personal experiences.},

  abstract = {We develop a novel approach to the semantic analysis of short text segments and demonstrate its utility on a large corpus of Web search queries. Extracting meaning from short text segments is difficult as there is little semantic redundancy between terms; hence methods based on shallow semantic analysis may fail to accurately estimate meaning. Furthermore search queries lack explicit syntax often used to determine intent in question answering. In this paper we propose a hybrid model of semantic analysis combining explicit class-label extraction with a latent class PCFG. This class-label correlation (CLC) model admits a robust parallel approximation, allowing it to scale to large amounts of query data. We demonstrate its performance in terms of (1) its predicted label accuracy on polysemous queries and (2) its ability to accurately chunk queries into base constituents.},

This essay, which builds on an emerging literature around decentralized social media, seeks to give an overview of the Fediverse, its benefits and drawbacks, and how government action can influence and encourage its development.Part I describes the Fediverse and how it works, beginning with a general description of open versus closed protocols and then proceeding to a description of the current Fediverse ecosystem, focusing on its major protocols and applications. Part II looks at the specific issue of content moderation on the Fediverse, using Mastodon, a Twitter-like microblogging service, as a case study to draw out the advantages and disadvantages of the federated content-moderation approach as compared to the current dominant closed-platform model. Part III considers how policymakers can encourage the Fediverse, whether through direct regulation, antitrust enforcement, or liability shields.},

We identify common challenges, structure solutions, and provide recommendations for future systems.

  abstract = {Important questions about the scientific community, e.g., what authors are the experts in a certain field, or are actively engaged in international collaborations, can be answered using publicly available datasets. However, data required to answer such questions is often scattered over multiple isolated datasets. Recently, the Knowledge Graph (KG) concept has been identified as a means for interweaving heterogeneous datasets and enhancing answer completeness and soundness. We present a pipeline for creating high quality knowledge graphs that comprise data collected from multiple isolated structured datasets. As proof of concept, we illustrate the different steps in the construction of a knowledge graph in the domain of scholarly communication metadata (SCM-KG). Particularly, we demonstrate the benefits of exploiting semantic web technology to reconcile data about authors, papers, and conferences. We conducted an experimental study on an SCM-KG that merges scientific research metadata from the DBLP bibliographic source and the Microsoft Academic Graph. The observed results provide evidence that queries are processed more effectively on top of the SCM-KG than over the isolated datasets, while execution time is not negatively affected.},

  abstract = {The most pressing problems in science are neither empirical nor theoretical, but infrastructural. Scientific practice is defined by coproductive, mutually reinforcing infrastructural deficits and incentive systems that everywhere constrain and contort our art of curiosity in service of profit and prestige. Our infrastructural problems are not unique to science, but reflective of the broader logic of digital enclosure where platformatized control of information production and extraction fuels some of the largest corporations in the world. I have taken lessons learned from decades of intertwined digital cultures within and beyond academia like wikis, pirates, and librarians in order to draft a path towards more liberatory infrastructures for both science and society. Based on a system of peer-to-peer linked data, I sketch interoperable systems for shared data, tools, and knowledge that map onto three domains of platform capture: storage, computation and communication. The challenge of infrastructure is not solely technical, but also social and cultural, and so I attempt to ground a practical development blueprint in an ethics for organizing and maintaining it. I intend this draft as a rallying call for organization, to be revised with the input of collaborators and through the challenges posed by its implementation. I argue that a more liberatory future for science is neither utopian nor impractical -- the truly impractical choice is to continue to organize science as prestige fiefdoms resting on a pyramid scheme of underpaid labor, playing out the clock as every part of our work is swallowed whole by circling information conglomerates. It was arguably scientists looking for a better way to communicate that created something as radical as the internet in the first place, and I believe we can do it again.},

  abstract = {OpenAlex has transferred practically all works from MAG preserving their bibliographic data publication year, volume, first and last page, DOI as well as the number of references that are important ingredients of citation analysis. More than 90\% of the MAG documents have equivalent document types in OpenAlex. Of the remaining ones, especially reclassifications to the OpenAlex document types {$<$}em{$>$}journal-article{$<$}/em{$>$} and {$<$}em{$>$}book-chapter{$<$}/em{$>$} seem to be valid and amount to more than 7\%, so that the document type specifications have improved significantly from MAG to OpenAlex. So far, OpenAlex seems to be more suited for bibliometric analyses than MAG. As last item of bibliometric relevant metadata, we looked at the paper-based subject classification via FoS in MAG and in OpenAlex. We found significantly more documents with a FoS assignment in OpenAlex than in MAG. On the first and second level, the FoS structure is identical resp. nearly identical, but on the deeper levels the number of available FoSs is drastically reduced to about 10\%. But this would not pose a problem if using only the upper two levels for bibliometric analyses as was done by Scheidsteger, et al. However, the reclassifications might cause changes to conclusions of previous studies. The consequences of the proliferation and abundant reclassification of top-level FoSs need to be studied more in detail. Reclassifications at the deeper levels should be studied, too. Overall, OpenAlex seems to be at least as suited for bibliometric analyses as MAG for publication years before 2021. However, this first impression needs to be checked by further detailed studies.},

The literature distinguishes three strategies that corporations commonly employ to respond to legitimacy problems: adapt to external expectations, manipulate the perception of their stakeholders, or engage in a discourse with those who question their legitimacy. We discuss three approaches to determine the appropriate response strategy: one-best-way approach, contingency approach, and paradox approach. We argue that in the face of heterogeneous environments with conflicting demands, corporations that follow a paradox approach are likely to be more successful in preserving their legitimacy than those that adopt one of the other two approaches. We develop a theoretical framework for the application of different response strategies and explore the management of paradoxes by way of structural, contextual, or reflective means.},

  abstract = {Critics have been converging around the logic of colonialism to describe the Internet economy. If we are serious about the laden language of the colonial, we should be ready to learn from struggles against pre-digital empires and colonial regimes. Although acts of insurrection may attract more attention, one thing leaders and theorists of anticolonial resistance have stressed persistently is the centrality of self-governance in everyday life as both a means and end of their movements. But the dominant platforms for online communities are not well-suited for durable self-governing. Resistance often relies on the same colonial firms it opposes. What would community-governed technologies look like? This paper introduces the concept of ``governable stacks'', a framework for self-governing as resistance to digital colonialism.},

The importance of studying the type pf business model on which a platform's growth or administration is based is here argued for, in order to be able to understand the logics of its growth, for example into multiple branches. Not only does an increasing number of social sectors and industries become dominated by digitally originated platform operators; also traditional institutional actors are increasingly adopting data-driven platform logics \textendash{} utilising and analysing consumer data in order to predict particular outcomes in order to automate and outsource decision-making.

The notions of relevance, usefulness, and trustworthiness with respect to information were already overloaded and often difficult to articulate, study, or implement. Newly surfaced proposals that aim to use large language models to generate relevant information for a user's needs pose even greater threat to transparency, provenance, and user interactions in a search system. In this perspective paper we revisit the problem of search in the larger context of information seeking and argue that removing or reducing interactions in an effort to retrieve presumably more relevant information can be detrimental to many fundamental aspects of search, including information verification, information literacy, and serendipity. In addition to providing suggestions for counteracting some of the potential problems posed by such models, we present a vision for search systems that are intelligent and effective, while also providing greater transparency and accountability.},

Knowledge-driven systems for decision-making in health care applications are powerful tools to help provide actionable and explainable insights to patients and practitioners. In such systems, knowledge about the particular patient current condition, historical ailments, etc. is central to enable personalized health care. An example of such a system for personalized health care is a diet and lifestyle decision-making tool for diabetic patients. This system may utilize knowledge from several domain-specific knowledge graphs (KGs), such as a KG of diabetes health care guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and a KG of food and nutrition such as FoodKG [4]. Knowledge about a particular patient is used here to perform context-aware reasoning and personalization of down-stream applications. For example, what the system recommends as a ''healthy'' meal may differ for among patients based on personal aspects like their current weight or exercise habits. To facilitate reasoning and decision-making based on personal context, such systems can benefit from integrating personal knowledge about the patient.

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6\% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17\%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.},

At the core of MAS is a heterogeneous entity graph comprised of six types of entities that model the scholarly activities: field of study, author, institution, paper, venue, and event. In addition to obtaining these entities from the publisher feeds as in the previous effort, we in this version include data mining results from the Web index and an in-house knowledge base from Bing, a major commercial search engine. As a result of the Bing integration, the new MAS graph sees significant increase in size, with fresh information streaming in automatically following their discoveries by the search engine. In addition, the rich entity relations included in the knowledge base provide additional signals to disambiguate and enrich the entities within and beyond the academic domain. The number of papers indexed by MAS, for instance, has grown from low tens of millions to 83 million while maintaining an above 95\% accuracy based on test data sets derived from academic activities at Microsoft Research. Based on the data set, we demonstrate two scenarios in this work: a knowledge driven, highly interactive dialog that seamlessly combines reactive search and proactive suggestion experience, and a proactive heterogeneous entity recommendation.},

  abstract = {As language models become more powerful, training and evaluation are increasingly bottlenecked by the data and metrics used for a particular task.  For example, summarization models are often trained to predict human reference summaries and evaluated using ROUGE, but both of these metrics are rough proxies for what we really care about---summary quality. In this work, we show that it is possible to significantly improve summary quality by training a model to optimize for human preferences.  We collect a large, high-quality dataset of human comparisons between summaries, train a model to predict the human-preferred summary, and use that model as a reward function to fine-tune a summarization policy using reinforcement learning. We apply our method to a version of the TL;DR dataset of Reddit posts and find that our models significantly outperform both human reference summaries and much larger models fine-tuned with supervised learning alone. Our models also transfer to CNN/DM news articles, producing summaries nearly as good as the human reference without any news-specific fine-tuning.  We conduct extensive analyses to understand our human feedback dataset and fine-tuned models.  We establish that our reward model generalizes to new datasets, and that optimizing our reward model results in better summaries than optimizing ROUGE according to humans.  We hope the evidence from our paper motivates machine learning researchers to pay closer attention to how their training loss affects the model behavior they actually want.},

  abstract = {Over some seven decades, a rather mundane transition that in its thoroughness and consequences has gone largely unacknowledged, has taken place, namely the revolution in modern information systems (IS) that guide organizations in their actions. Today, it is fair to say that IS have come to rule the world. They do this literally, by the rules they embody, which dictate how much of everyday life, as it relates to individuals and organizations and the transactions they engage in, takes place around the globe. In essence, IS have become important social and economic infrastructure. Seeking an understanding of how this has come about, I review historical developments in IS, focusing in particular on accounting systems, enterprise systems, retail automation, and electronic commerce. I argue that it is transactions and their facilitation that lie at the heart of IS and its development as a field of practice. I reflect on why this has gone mostly overlooked as such. I consider where we have now arrived with transaction facilitation as infrastructure and its importance in the light of current issues. I suggest how future studies might contribute to our learning more about where we should want to be with our transaction facilitation infrastructure.},

Drawing on research into digital media and identities, combined with mediatization theories, I show how the platforms: (a) embrace datafication logic (gathering as much data as possible and pinpointing the data to a particular unit); (b) translate the logic into design and governance of profiles (update stream and profile core); and (c) coax\textemdash at times coerce\textemdash their users into making of abundant but anchored selves, that is, performing identities which are capacious, complex, and volatile but singular and coherent at the same time.},

Google annihilates your privacy and Facebook amplifies right-wing propaganda because it is profitable to do so. But the internet wasn't always like this\textemdash it had to be remade for the purposes of profit maximization, through a years-long process of privatization that turned a small research network into a powerhouse of global capitalism. Tarnoff tells the story of the privatization that made the modern internet, and which set in motion the crises that consume it today. The solution to those crises is straightforward: deprivatize the internet. Deprivatization aims at creating an internet where people, and not profit, rule. It calls for shrinking the space of the market and diminishing the power of the profit motive. It calls for abolishing the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, and the other giants that dominate our digital lives and developing publicly and cooperatively owned alternatives that encode real democratic control. To build a better internet, we need to change how it is owned and organized. Not with an eye towards making markets work better, but towards making them less dominant. Not in order to create a more competitive or more rule-bound version of privatization, but to overturn it. Otherwise, a small number of executives and investors will continue to make choices on everyone's behalf, and these choices will remain tightly bound by the demands of the market. It's time to demand an internet by, and for, the people now.},

A series of experimental studies demonstrate that both involvement and the psychological condition of power meditate consumers' willingness to purchase. As a result, we find that consumers are more likely to purchase low involvement than high - involvement products through VA technology, particularly when experiencing high - power states. This study broadens our understanding of the role of VAs and their ability to shape the consumer decision - making process. With an explicit focus on power, this study illustrates how the success of voice commerce may largely rest on the promotion of low - involvement products that enable high - power psychological conditions which drive willingness to purchase.},

  abstract = {The latest advances in Artificial Intelligence and (deep) Machine Learning in particular revealed a major drawback of modern intelligent systems, namely the inability to explain their decisions in a way that humans can easily understand. While eXplainable AI rapidly became an active area of research in response to this need for improved understandability and trustworthiness, the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) has on the other hand a long-standing tradition in managing information in a symbolic, human-understandable form. This book provides the first comprehensive collection of research contributions on the role of knowledge graphs for eXplainable AI (KG4XAI), and the papers included here present academic and industrial research focused on the theory, methods and implementations of AI systems that use structured knowledge to generate reliable explanations. Introductory material on knowledge graphs is included for those readers with only a minimal background in the field, as well as specific chapters devoted to advanced methods, applications and case-studies that use knowledge graphs as a part of knowledge-based, explainable systems (KBX-systems). The final chapters explore current challenges and future research directions in the area of knowledge graphs for eXplainable AI. The book not only provides a scholarly, state-of-the-art overview of research in this subject area, but also fosters the hybrid combination of symbolic and subsymbolic AI methods, and will be of interest to all those working in the field.},

  abstract = {Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness among core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these ``knowledge graphs'' (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally accepted, open-access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open-source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates) representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomic structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.},

Based on the PRISMA approach and empirical analysis of some international cases are adopted. The authors analyze different organizational and environmental factors, the objectives, benefits, and risks of AI-supported decision-making. The findings show an increasing interest in the research on government decision-making based on AI. Finally, there is the potential of AI to support decision-making for the benefit of citizens and public value generation, collaboratively between governments, industry, and society. Future work will further analyze AI-based decision-making in government in depth.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {The central argument of this paper is that the design, implementation and use of technologies that underpin general semantic search have implications for what we know and the way in which knowledge is understood. Semantic search is an assemblage of technologies that most Internet users would use regularly without necessarily realising. Users of search engines implementing semantic search can obtain answers to questions rather than just retrieve pages that include their search query. This paper critically examines the design of the Semantic Web, upon which semantic search is based. It demonstrates that implicit in the design of the Semantic Web are particular assumptions about the nature of classification and the nature of knowledge. The Semantic Web was intended for interoperability within specific domains. It is here argued that the extension to general semantic search, for use by the general public, has implications for what type of knowledge is visible and what counts as legitimate knowledge. The provision of a definitive answer to a query, via the reduction of discursive knowledge into machine-processable data, provides the illusion of objectivity and authority in a way that is increasingly impenetrable to critical scrutiny.},

The knowledge extracted by these AI agents is organized into a heterogeneous graph, called Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), where the nodes and the edges represent the entities engaging in scholarly communications and the relationships among them, respectively. The frequently updated data set and a few software tools central to the underlying AI components are distributed under an open data license for research and commercial applications. This paper describes the design, schema, and technical and business motivations behind MAG and elaborates how MAG can be used in analytics, search, and recommendation scenarios. How AI plays an important role in avoiding various biases and human induced errors in other data sets and how the technologies can be further improved in the future are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Since the relaunch of Microsoft Academic Services (MAS) 4 years ago, scholarly communications have undergone dramatic changes: more ideas are being exchanged online, more authors are sharing their data, and more software tools used to make discoveries and reproduce the results are being distributed openly. The sheer amount of information available is overwhelming for individual humans to keep up and digest. In the meantime, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have made great strides and the cost of computing has plummeted to the extent that it has become practical to employ intelligent agents to comprehensively collect and analyze scholarly communications. MAS is one such effort and this paper describes its recent progresses since the last disclosure. As there are plenty of independent studies affirming the effectiveness of MAS, this paper focuses on the use of three key AI technologies that underlies its prowess in capturing scholarly communications with adequate quality and broad coverage: (1) natural language understanding in extracting factoids from individual articles at the web scale, (2) knowledge assisted inference and reasoning in assembling the factoids into a knowledge graph, and (3) a reinforcement learning approach to assessing scholarly importance for entities participating in scholarly communications, called the saliency, that serves both as an analytic and a predictive metric in MAS. These elements enhance the capabilities of MAS in supporting the studies of science of science based on the GOTO principle, i.e., good and open data with transparent and objective methodologies. The current direction of development and how to access the regularly updated data and tools from MAS, including the knowledge graph, a REST API and a website, are also described.},

Through the ownership and control of information, this emergent class dominates not only labour but capital as traditionally understood as well. And it's not just tech companies like Amazon and Google. Even Walmart and Nike can now dominate the entire production chain through the ownership of not much more than brands, patents, copyrights, and logistical systems. While techno-utopian apologists still celebrate these innovations as an improvement on capitalism, for workers\textemdash and the planet\textemdash it's worse. The new ruling class uses the powers of information to route around any obstacle labor and social movements put up. So how do we find a way out? Capital Is Dead offers not only the theoretical tools to analyze this new world, but ways to change it. Drawing on the writings of a surprising range of classic and contemporary theorists, Wark offers an illuminating overview of the contemporary condition and the emerging class forces that control\textemdash and contest\textemdash it.},

  abstract = {Standardisation is key to shaping new technologies and supporting major ongoing trends, such as the increased importance of platforms, developing `smart' technologies and innovating large-scale complex systems. Standardisation plays a key role in shaping the rules that govern these developments and their effects on society. Due to the large variety of actors involved in these trends, the associated standardisation processes are likely to involve all three modes of standardisation identified in the literature: committee-based, market-based and government-based. This multi-mode standardisation challenges the theoretical views on standardisation which predominantly focus on one of the modes. In this paper, we review the existing literatures on individual modes and on multi-mode standardisation. By recombining existing evidence, we generate new insights into multimode standardisation processes. These first insights relate to the contributions that each mode can make to such processes' outcomes and suggest that their impact depends on factors, such as their initiation's timing and the institutional context in which the standardisation process occurs. Moreover, we consider the conditions under which actors can launch each mode. Based on our observations, we formulate an agenda for future research to obtain a better understanding of multi-mode standardisation. We offer recommendations for industry actors, NGOs, researchers and policy makers involved in shaping technological and societal change.},

One major reason for this trend is the mature development process that is supported by large companies and sophisticated conversational platforms. However, the required development steps are mostly done manually while transforming existing knowledge bases into interaction configurations, s.t., algorithms integrated into the conversational platforms are enabled to learn the intended interaction patterns. However, already existing domain knowledge may get vanished while transforming a structured knowledge base into a ``flat'' text representation without references backwards. In this paper, we aim for an automatic process dedicated to generating interaction configurations for a conversational platform (Google Dialogflow) from an existing domain-specific knowledge base. Our ultimate goal is to generate chatbot configurations automatically, s.t., the quality and efficiency are increased.},

With the continued growth of repositories of biomedical data and knowledge, increasingly varied kinds of information are available to train machine learning approaches to drug repurposing. However, existing efforts to integrate a diversity of data sources have been limited to only a small selection of data types, typically gene expression data, drug structural information, and protein interaction networks. In this study, we leverage a graph-based approach to integrate biological knowledge from 20 publicly accessible repositories to represent information involving 11 distinct bioentity types. We then employ a graph node embedding scheme and use utilize a random forest model to make novel predictions about which drugs can be used to treat certain diseases. Utilizing this approach, we find a performance improvement over existing computational drug repurposing approaches and find promising drug repositioning targets, including drug and disease pairs currently in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Since the emergence of scholarly big data, there have been several efforts for web-based services such as digital library search engines (DLSEs). However, much of the design and specifications of an accessible, usable, scalable, and sustainable DLSE have not been well represented and discussed in the literature. We argue that these four characteristics are essential to providing a high-quality service for scholarly big data from both the user and developer's perspectives. This paper reviews the design, implementation, and operation experiences, and lessons of CiteSeerX, a real-world digital library search engine. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the current design, and proposed a new design with a revised architecture, enhanced hardware, and software infrastructure. The Alpha version of the new design has been implemented and tested. The new system replaces MySQL and Apache Solr with a single instance of Elasticsearch, which plays a dual role of data storage and search. Another major improvement is the integration of extraction and ingestion, which significantly boosts document ingestion speed. The web application is re-engineered to enhance the user experience by applying a learning-to-rank model and offering more refined search tools. The system is also improved in many other aspects. We believe the design considerations and experience can benefit researchers and engineers who plan, design, and upgrade future systems with comparable scales and functionalities.},

  abstract = {Existing benchmarks for grounding language in interactive environments either lack real-world linguistic elements, or prove difficult to scale up due to substantial human involvement in the collection of data or feedback signals. To bridge this gap, we develop WebShop -- a simulated e-commerce website environment with \$1.18\$ million real-world products and \$12,087\$ crowd-sourced text instructions. Given a text instruction specifying a product requirement, an agent needs to navigate multiple types of webpages and issue diverse actions to find, customize, and purchase an item. WebShop provides several challenges for language grounding including understanding compositional instructions, query (re-)formulation, comprehending and acting on noisy text in webpages, and performing strategic exploration. We collect over \$1,600\$ human demonstrations for the task, and train and evaluate a diverse range of agents using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and pre-trained image and language models. Our best model achieves a task success rate of \$29\textbackslash\%\$, which outperforms rule-based heuristics (\$9.6\textbackslash\%\$) but is far lower than human expert performance (\$59\textbackslash\%\$). We also analyze agent and human trajectories and ablate various model components to provide insights for developing future agents with stronger language understanding and decision making abilities. Finally, we show that agents trained on WebShop exhibit non-trivial sim-to-real transfer when evaluated on amazon.com and ebay.com, indicating the potential value of WebShop in developing practical web-based agents that can operate in the wild.},

  abstract = {Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the user's next action based on short and dynamic sessions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in utilizing various elaborately designed graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the pair-wise relationships among items, seemingly suggesting the design of more complicated models is the panacea for improving the empirical performance. However, these models achieve relatively marginal improvements with exponential growth in model complexity. In this paper, we dissect the classical GNN-based SBR models and empirically find that some sophisticated GNN propagations are redundant, given the readout module plays a significant role in GNN-based models. Based on this observation, we intuitively propose to remove the GNN propagation part, while the readout module will take on more responsibility in the model reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Multi-Level Attention Mixture Network (Atten-Mixer), which leverages both concept-view and instance-view readouts to achieve multi-level reasoning over item transitions. As simply enumerating all possible high-level concepts is infeasible for large real-world recommender systems, we further incorporate SBR-related inductive biases, i.e., local invariance and inherent priority to prune the search space. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal. We also have already launched the proposed techniques to a large-scale e-commercial online service since April 2021, with significant improvements of top-tier business metrics demonstrated in the online experiments on live traffic.},

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 has intricate mechanisms for initiating infection, immune evasion/suppression and replication that depend on the structure and dynamics of its constituent proteins. Many protein structures have been solved, but far less is known about their relevant conformational changes. To address this challenge, over a million citizen scientists banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing project to create the first exascale computer and simulate 0.1\,seconds of the viral proteome. Our adaptive sampling simulations predict dramatic opening of the apo spike complex, far beyond that seen experimentally, explaining and predicting the existence of `cryptic' epitopes. Different spike variants modulate the probabilities of open versus closed structures, balancing receptor binding and immune evasion. We also discover dramatic conformational changes across the proteome, which reveal over 50 `cryptic' pockets that expand targeting options for the design of antivirals. All data and models are freely available online, providing a quantitative structural atlas.},
