  abstract = {SPARQL query services that balance processing between clients and servers become more and more essential to handle the increasing load for open and decentralized knowledge graphs on the Web. To this end, Linked Data Fragments (LDF) have introduced a foundational framework that has sparked research exploring a spectrum of potential Web querying interfaces in between server-side query processing via SPARQL endpoints and client-side query processing of data dumps. Current proposals in between typically suffer from imbalanced load on either the client or the server. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first work that combines both client-side and server-side query optimization techniques in a truly dynamic fashion: we introduce WiseKG, a system that employs a cost model that dynamically delegates the load between servers and clients by combining client-side processing of shipped partitions with efficient server-side processing of star-shaped sub-queries, based on current server workload and client capabilities. Our experiments show that WiseKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of average total query execution time per client, while at the same time decreasing network traffic and increasing server-side availability.},

The advancement of experimental hardware also empowers researchers to reach a level of accuracy that was not possible in the past. Marching toward the next generation of self-driving laboratories, the orchestration of both resources lies at the focal point of autonomous discovery in chemical science. To achieve such a goal, algorithmically accessible data representations and standardized communication protocols are indispensable. In this perspective, we recategorize the recently introduced approach based on Materials Acceleration Platforms into five functional components and discuss recent case studies that focus on the data representation and exchange scheme between different components. Emerging technologies for interoperable data representation and multi-agent systems are also discussed with their recent applications in chemical automation. We hypothesize that knowledge graph technology, orchestrating semantic web technologies and multi-agent systems, will be the driving force to bring data to knowledge, evolving our way of automating the laboratory.},

We formulate various requirements for a fully-fledged KGMS. In particular, such a system must be capable of performing complex reasoning tasks but, at the same time, achieve efficient and scalable reasoning over Big Data with an acceptable computational complexity. Moreover, a KGMS needs interfaces to corporate databases, the web, and machine-learning and analytics packages. We present KRR formalisms and a system achieving these goals. To this aim, we use specific suitable fragments from the Datalog\$\$\^\textbackslash pm \$\${$\pm$}family of languages, and we introduce the vadalog system, which puts these swift logics into action. This system exploits the theoretical underpinning of relevant Datalog\$\$\^\textbackslash pm \$\${$\pm$}languages and combines it with existing and novel techniques from database and AI practice.},

  abstract = {This article examines the intersection of two structural developments: the growth of surveillance and the rise of ?big data.? Drawing on observations and interviews conducted within the Los Angeles Police Department, I offer an empirical account of how the adoption of big data analytics does?and does not?transform police surveillance practices. I argue that the adoption of big data analytics facilitates amplifications of prior surveillance practices and fundamental transformations in surveillance activities. First, discretionary assessments of risk are supplemented and quantified using risk scores. Second, data are used for predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes. Third, the proliferation of automatic alert systems makes it possible to systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people. Fourth, the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact. Fifth, previously separate data systems are merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of institutions. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model of big data surveillance that can be applied to institutional domains beyond the criminal justice system. Finally, I highlight the social consequences of big data surveillance for law and social inequality.},

These are core concerns for researchers working within the area of critical information studies\textemdash yet these companies have also demonstrated novel tactics for obscuring their operations, reducing the ability of scholars to speak about how harms are perpetuated or to link them to larger systems. While scholars' methods and ethical conventions have historically privileged the agency of research participants, the current landscape suggests the value of exploring methods that would reveal actions that are purposefully hidden. We propose investigation as a model for critical information studies and review the methods and epistemological conventions of investigative journalists as a provocative example, noting that their orientation toward those in power enables them to discuss societal harms in ways that academic researchers often cannot. We conclude by discussing key topics, such as process accountability and institutional norms, that should feature in discussions of how academic researchers might position investigation in relation to their own work.},

The Freebase knowledge base was a major Semantic Web and linked data technology that was acquired by Google in 2010 to support the Google Knowledge Graph, the backend for Google search results that include structured answers to queries instead of a series of links to external resources. After its shutdown in 2016, Freebase is contained in a data dump of 1.9 billion Resource Description Format (RDF) triples. A recomposition of the Freebase ontology will be analyzed in relation to concepts and insights from the literature on classification by Bowker and Star. This paper will explore how the Freebase ontology is shaped by many of the forces that also shape classification systems through a deep dive into the ontology and a small correlational study. These findings will provide a glimpse into the proprietary blackbox Knowledge Graph and what is meant by Google's mission to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful".},

  abstract = {With the recent increase in the interest of individuals in health, lifecare, and disease, hospital medical services have been shifting from a treatment focus to prevention and health management. The medical industry is creating additional services for health- and life-promotion programs. This change represents a medical-service paradigm shift due to the prolonged life expectancy, aging, lifestyle changes, and income increases, and consequently, the concept of the smart health service has emerged as a major issue. Due to smart health, the existing health-promotion medical services that typically have been operated by large hospitals have been developing into remote medical-treatment services where personal health records are used in small hospitals; moreover, a further expansion has been occurring in the direction of u-Healthcare in which health conditions are continuously monitored in the everyday lives of the users. However, as the amount of data is increasing and the medical-data complexity is intensifying, the limitations of the previous approaches are increasingly problematic; furthermore, since even the same disease can show different symptoms depending on the personal health conditions, lifestyle, and genome information, universal healthcare is not effective for some patients, and it can even generate severe side effects. Thus, research on the AI-based healthcare that is in the form of mining-based smart health, which is a convergence technology of the 4IR, is actively being carried out. Particularly, the introduction of various smart medical equipment for which healthcare big data and a running machine have been combined and the expansion of the distribution of smartphone wearable devices have led to innovations such as personalized diagnostic and treatment services and chronic-disease management and prevention services. In addition, various already launched applications allow users to check their own health conditions and receive the corresponding feedback in real time. Based on these innovations, the preparation of a way to determine a user's current health conditions, and to respond properly through contextual feedback in the case of unsound health conditions, is underway. However, since the previously made healthcare-related applications need to be linked to a wearable device, and they provide medical feedback to users based solely on specific biometric data, inaccurate information can be provided. In addition, the user interfaces of some healthcare applications are very complicated, causing user inconvenience regarding the attainment of desired information. Therefore, we propose a chatbot-based healthcare service with a knowledge base for cloud computing. The proposed method is a mobile health service in the form of a chatbot for the provision of fast treatment in response to accidents that may occur in everyday life, and also in response to changes of the conditions of patients with chronic diseases. A chatbot is an intelligent conversation platform that interacts with users via a chatting interface, and since its use can be facilitated by linkages with the major social network service messengers, general users can easily access and receive various health services. The proposed framework enables a smooth human\textendash robot interaction that supports the efficient implementation of the chatbot healthcare service. The design of the framework comprises the following four levels: data level, information level, knowledge level, and service level.},

While Google coined the term ``Knowledge Graph'' in 2012, there are also a few openly available knowledge graphs, with DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase being among the most prominent ones. Those graphs are often constructed from semi-structured knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or harvested from the web with a combination of statistical and linguistic methods. The result are large-scale knowledge graphs that try to make a good trade-off between completeness and correctness. In order to further increase the utility of such knowledge graphs, various refinement methods have been proposed, which try to infer and add missing knowledge to the graph, or identify erroneous pieces of information. In this article, we provide a survey of such knowledge graph refinement approaches, with a dual look at both the methods being proposed as well as the evaluation methodologies used.},

The conflicts surrounding Internet governance are the new spaces where political and economic power is unfolding in the twenty-first century.This all-important study by Laura DeNardis reveals the inner power structure already in place within the architectures and institutions of Internet governance. It provides a theoretical framework for Internet governance that takes into account the privatization of global power as well as the role of sovereign nations and international treaties. In addition, DeNardis explores what is at stake in open global controversies and stresses the responsibility of the public to actively engage in these debates, because Internet governance will ultimately determine Internet freedom.},

Since knowledge graphs contain both the data as well as its semantically described schema (ontology), they enable novel ontology-driven software architectures, in which the domain knowledge and business logic can completely reside on the knowledge graph level. This article further introduces such a use case: an ontology-driven frontend implementation, which is able to fully adapt itself based on the underlying knowledge graph schema and dynamically render information in the desired manner.},

Its popularity is clearly influenced by the introduction of Google's Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a definition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google's Knowledge Graph, although no official documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a definition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and defining the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a definition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision.},

In contrast to traditional 'schema-on-write' approaches such as data warehouses, data lakes are repositories storing raw data in its original formats and providing a common access interface. Despite the strong interest raised from both academia and industry, there is a large body of ambiguity regarding the definition, functions and available technologies for data lakes. A complete, coherent picture of data lake challenges and solutions is still missing. This survey reviews the development, architectures, and systems of data lakes. We provide a comprehensive overview of research questions for designing and building data lakes. We classify the existing approaches and systems based on their provided functions for data lakes, which makes this survey a useful technical reference for designing, implementing and deploying data lakes. We hope that the thorough comparison of existing solutions and the discussion of open research challenges in this survey will motivate the future development of data lake research and practice.},

  abstract = {Several industry-specific metadata initiatives have historically facilitated structured data modeling for the web in domains such as commerce, publishing, social media, etc. The metadata vocabularies produced by these initiatives allow developers to `wrap' information on the web to provide machine-readable signals for search engines, advertisers, and user-facing content on apps and websites, thus assisting with surfacing facts about people, places, and products. A universal iteration of such a project called Schema.org started in 2011, resulting from a partnership between Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex to collaborate on a single structured data model across domains. Yet, few studies have explored the metadata vocabulary terms in this significant web resource. What terms are included, upon what subject domains do they focus, and how does Schema.org represent knowledge in its conceptual model? This paper presents findings from our extraction and analysis of the documented release history and complete hierarchy on Schema.org's developer pages. We provide a semantic network visualization of Schema.org, including an analysis of its modularity and domains, and discuss its global significance concerning fact-checking and COVID-19. We end by theorizing Schema.org as a gatekeeper of data on the web that authors vocabulary that everyday web users encounter in their searches.},

The company supplies information technology solutions for data integration and tracking to police and government agencies, humanitarian organizations, and corporations. To illuminate and learn more about Palantir's opaque surveillance practices, we begin by sketching Palantir's company history and contract network, followed by an explanation of key terms associated with Palantir's technology area and a description of the firm's platform ecosystem. We then summarize current scholarship on Palantir's continuing role in policing, intelligence, and security operations. Our primary contribution and analysis are a computational topic modeling of Palantir's surveillance patents (n\,=\,155), including their topics and themes. We end by discussing the concept of infrastructuring to understand Palantir as a surveillance platform, where we theorize information standards like administrative metadata as phenomena for structuring social worlds in and through access to digital information.},

We demonstrate how CSKG can provide evidence for generalizable downstream reasoning and for pre-training of language models.

Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\textendash environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as ``what is here,'' ``what happened here before,'' and ``how does this region compare to \ldots '' for any region on earth within seconds.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the ethical implications of Google's Knowledge Graph. The paper argues that in the advent and implementation of said Knowledge Graph, the role of Google in users' lives and the power held by Google as the key intermediary of information must be scrutinized. Design/methodology/approach Revisiting existing literature on Google and its impact on knowledge culture, the paper seeks to assess whether the implementation of The Knowledge Graph represents a significant shift in the nature (or use) of the service. Findings The paper concludes that the extension to Google Search, The Knowledge Graph, can serve to radicalize Google's position as a key intermediary of information in users' lives. Rather than simply serving as a gatekeeper supplying the user with an array of links matching a given query, Google now conveniently disseminates information on their own site, roughly rendering the remainder of the web superfluous. Considering both the commercial nature and the opacity of the service, Google as a de facto solo editor of information is worrying from both a democratic and ethical perspective. A culture of emphatic insistence on convenience and consumption is likely to contribute to the impediment of autonomous information retrieval and digital literacy. Research limitations/implications The paper must be considered a preliminary inquiry into Google's reliability as an editor of the body of knowledge. As of yet, no literature specifically has remarked on The Knowledge Graph. Originality/value This paper examines whether the newest extension of Google Search, The Knowledge Graph, poses any significant changes to the assessment of the service and its role in the culture. Fostering critical, digital literacy in search engine users is deemed of even more vital importance to society with the implementation of The Knowledge Graph. This paper, preliminary and far from exhaustive, seeks to initiate a discussion on the future responsibilities of Google, scholars and users in securing the ideal of critical digital literacy.},

We introduce our pilots and their focus within the MindLab Project, which aims to build Knowledge Graphs with a lifecycle-based approach to enable conversational agents. We describe and evaluate our pipeline for the first step of the lifecycle, namely Knowledge Creation. Our approach satisfies all defined requirements in terms of provenance tracking, scalability, and usability.},

  abstract = {Google Knowledge Graph is more complicated than public knowledge graphs when it comes to retrieving and reusing data for e.g. building custom KGs or concept maps. This is because even though there is a dedicated graph search API, it only offers information about individual entities without links to other relevant resources that are only available in Google search knowledge panels. In this paper, we present Knowledge Graph Viewer, a tool that utilizes both the graph search API and knowledge panels in order to obtain relationships between graph entities to reconstruct custom substructures of the large knowledge base. This demo will showcase its usage and functionalities in each step of the KG creation while explaining the concept behind the workflow.},

  abstract = {The latest advances in Artificial Intelligence and (deep) Machine Learning in particular revealed a major drawback of modern intelligent systems, namely the inability to explain their decisions in a way that humans can easily understand. While eXplainable AI rapidly became an active area of research in response to this need for improved understandability and trustworthiness, the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) has on the other hand a long-standing tradition in managing information in a symbolic, human-understandable form. This book provides the first comprehensive collection of research contributions on the role of knowledge graphs for eXplainable AI (KG4XAI), and the papers included here present academic and industrial research focused on the theory, methods and implementations of AI systems that use structured knowledge to generate reliable explanations. Introductory material on knowledge graphs is included for those readers with only a minimal background in the field, as well as specific chapters devoted to advanced methods, applications and case-studies that use knowledge graphs as a part of knowledge-based, explainable systems (KBX-systems). The final chapters explore current challenges and future research directions in the area of knowledge graphs for eXplainable AI. The book not only provides a scholarly, state-of-the-art overview of research in this subject area, but also fosters the hybrid combination of symbolic and subsymbolic AI methods, and will be of interest to all those working in the field.},

  abstract = {In this radical and visionary new book, McKenzie Wark argues that information has empowered a new kind of ruling class. Through the ownership and control of information, this emergent class dominates not only labour but capital as traditionally understood as well. And it's not just tech companies like Amazon and Google. Even Walmart and Nike can now dominate the entire production chain through the ownership of not much more than brands, patents, copyrights, and logistical systems. While techno-utopian apologists still celebrate these innovations as an improvement on capitalism, for workers\textemdash and the planet\textemdash it's worse. The new ruling class uses the powers of information to route around any obstacle labor and social movements put up. So how do we find a way out? Capital Is Dead offers not only the theoretical tools to analyze this new world, but ways to change it. Drawing on the writings of a surprising range of classic and contemporary theorists, Wark offers an illuminating overview of the contemporary condition and the emerging class forces that control\textemdash and contest\textemdash it.},

  abstract = {Chatbots are nowadays being applied widely in different life domains. One major reason for this trend is the mature development process that is supported by large companies and sophisticated conversational platforms. However, the required development steps are mostly done manually while transforming existing knowledge bases into interaction configurations, s.t., algorithms integrated into the conversational platforms are enabled to learn the intended interaction patterns. However, already existing domain knowledge may get vanished while transforming a structured knowledge base into a ``flat'' text representation without references backwards. In this paper, we aim for an automatic process dedicated to generating interaction configurations for a conversational platform (Google Dialogflow) from an existing domain-specific knowledge base. Our ultimate goal is to generate chatbot configurations automatically, s.t., the quality and efficiency are increased.},

Knowledge graphs have become prevalent in both of industry and academic circles these years, to be one of the most efficient and effective knowledge integration approaches. Techniques for knowledge graph construction can mine information from either structured, semi-structured, or even unstructured data sources, and finally integrate the information into knowledge, represented in a graph. Furthermore, knowledge graph is able to organize information in an easy-to-maintain, easy-to-understand and easy-to-use manner.},
