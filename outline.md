# Summary

The Knowledge Graph Of Everything is a colonial surveillance project

Who is the universal knowledge graph for?

Surveillance capitalism dreams of a universal knowledge graph: In defense of vulgar infrastructures

An extension of "Linked Data or Surveillance Capitalism" in the infrastructure piece - arguing that infrastructure is not neutral and the kinds of knowledge graph infrastructure being built by the NSF and NIH is potentially harmful and not likely to resolve fundamental infrastructural deficits

What does the cloud want? The cloud dreams of lakes and a network of everything. imagining the futures of data infrastructure.

Surveillance capitalism is the dominant economic model, and so when a federal government intends to direct its research organizations to build new data infrastructures, we should take note. This piece is about how the cloud, as an assemblage of property relations and systematic logics structures and sets the horizon of what we can imagine our data infrastructure to be. Its vision of the future for our data is a graph of everything, where they host and graciously provide access to a universalized surveillance apparatus. Their future has autonomous reasoning agents sifting through endless lakes of data in order to provide us with the miraculous insight that holds us back from a seemingly immediately-realizable future where all poverty and climate change is solved. If only we have the right *insights.* Where we get data lakes to sift through with AI chatbot-like interfaces, they get to restructure and provide platforms/dashboards on the graph of everything as an infinity of new profit extraction mechanisms. It won't work for any of the lofty goals we intend for it, but it doesn't have to in order to fulfill its role as a profit-generating platform (see cognitive expectations of search)

Who owns the graph? Who *really* owns the graph?

In defense of vulgar linked data, where we dispense with the notion of a unified graph of everything as a colonial project, and instead re-imagine the future of our data as vernacular, local, oriented around the power of expression rather than the power of consumption. Data in their view is as a natural resource to be mined, extracted, and made sense of - it is "something out there" to be captured and harnessed. To be brought in line with the universal order of things. 

# Notes

## Open Knowledge Network Roadmap

- Driven by AI and need for lots of data to munch
- Criminal justice information
	- You can't just strap data onto an oppressive system and cure it - the system will use the data according to its existing (white supremacist) structure
- Access by anyone (Group K)
	- Federated graphs, being able to start up additional nodes good
	- "A graph owner can request to join the CKN"
	- Good discussions on need to have authorship associated with knowledge graph entries
	- Need for policies that govern graph use/modification
	- Use of decentralized identifiers/cryptographic signatures/hashes/etc.
- Biomedical
	- SPOKE
	- https://www.matebioservices.com/science
	- the failure of the public/private partnership model and the inevitability of platform capture


# Outline

- Arguments
	- Problematizing the "Graph of Everything"
	- Centralized ontologies bad
		- Don't work
		- Extremely labor intensive
		- Colonial project
		- patronizing at best - we can't know the solutions to these problems like poverty or whatever without advanced analytics is a lie: just ask the people involved what the problem is.
	- Cloud bad
		- Can't scale
		- Centralizes control
		- Easily captured as platform
		- Constrains possible actors and domains (even given their intention to allow zero-infra ppl to use graph)
	- Focus on AI bad
		- Junk predictions
		- Magical computers
		- Presuppose the problem is 'harnessing power of big data' rather than collective sensemaking
- Alternative
	- fundementally a linguistic project
	- focused on making tools as a means of expression and communication rather than databases to shove things into

## Extended Universe

- What about the trans database that TX built? Is that something we want our basic infrastructure to support?
	- The spirit of HIPPA - the p is for portability
- The extended universe of health technologies/wearables/etc.
	- The implied technologies and platforms from the rest of the projects in the NSF portfolio
- The general structure of slicing up the giant graph of everything and selling us some chunks of it + some proprietary compute on top
