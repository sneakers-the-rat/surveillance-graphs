- Introduction
	- Governments and Academics want to create data infrastructures for linking lots of heterogeneous data
	- Backing out: the backdrop is that we are in a state of purposeful knowledge disorganization. Why do we need these graphs and search in the first place? It's because standing in between people and information is ridiculously profitable
	- What will we create? Are we making public data infrastructure, or something else?
	- Central argument: The great Graph of Everything is a pipe dream sold to us by the cloud orthodoxy as a way of diverting funding to consolidate a new kind of barely working platform
	- Instead we might imagine a properly human data infrastructure: Beyond "scruffiness," we need properly vulgar linked data. 
- Arguments
	- Problematizing the "Graph of Everything"
	- Centralized ontologies bad
		- Don't work
		- Extremely labor intensive
		- Colonial project
		- patronizing at best - we can't know the solutions to these problems like poverty or whatever without advanced analytics is a lie: just ask the people involved what the problem is.
	- Cloud bad
		- Can't scale
		- Centralizes control
		- Easily captured as platform
		- Constrains possible actors and domains (even given their intention to allow zero-infra ppl to use graph)
	- Focus on AI bad
		- Junk predictions
		- Magical computers
		- Presuppose the problem is 'harnessing power of big data' rather than collective sensemaking. Data is something "out there" to be captured, rather than something that exists between people.
	- Broader scope on knowledge graphs - what else are they used for? why would this specifically be a problem for government knowledge graphs?
		- the graph is used as the basis for compute-based platforms. we might have some 
		- example of that biotech group that spun off the proprietary algorithm immediately
		- fundamentally broken incentive: you always have to make some part of some platform nonfunctional in order to have something to rent. this is literally rent-seeking behavior
	- gatekeeping doesn't make safety it makes exclusion!
		- making a single-space social system makes an intractable moderation problem
		- even the fedi has problems iwth this
		- but the cloud marketers are increasingly describing themselves as being the last bulwarks against misinformation - contrast that with the statements from the publishers to the same effects. 
	- Centralized ontologies always reflect the strong beliefs of what a system of representation shoudl be used for
		- use the example of the emoji shapes: https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18141r2-emoji-colors.pdf
		- and the backlash, which demonstrated that the consortium believed that the semantic uses of emoji were different than they could possibly be
		- and then ... wordle happened.

- Alternative
	- fundementally a linguistic project
	- focused on making tools as a means of expression and communication rather than databases to shove things into
