This resource, which the project calls the Federalism Data and Advanced Statistics Hub (F-DASH), has the potential to provide significant benefits to researchers, educators, and the public by integrating an unprecedented amount policy, social, and economic data, as well as developing analytic tools that will allow users to easily explore, visualize, and analyze these data. The project is a convergence research effort encompassing applied statistics, computer science, geography, philosophy, political science, public policy, and sociology. It also draws on technical expertise and channels for connecting the work to users through collaborations with several partner organizations, such as Open States, the Society for Public Health Educators, and the State Politics and Policy Section of the American Political Science Association. These collaborations and the overall F-DASH effort should facilitate breakthroughs by researchers, innovations by practitioners, new classroom materials for teachers, and new opportunities for engagement by citizens. Public policy at the state level has a direct impact on citizens? daily lives, including their health, education, and employment, and this phase I F-DASH project will provide immediate and accessible information on these and other topics. <br/><br/>The study of public policy is the study of how representative government in a federal system translates citizen preferences into laws that impact society. The American states represent an ideal venue for understanding the effects of policy choices because states routinely experiment with different solutions to important challenges. However, the decentralized nature of the American federal system impedes efforts to compare economic, social, or other outcomes across the states. Indeed, researchers must often engage in 50 separate data collection processes due to the unique challenges of data acquisition in each state. Consequently, researchers or government agencies commonly collect only the minimum of what they need to address a particular question. Moreover, they often do not share these data, and those who do make data publicly available have no obvious way to connect their data to data collected by others. The F-DASH will provide a centralized location for data collection and analysis related to institutions, policies, and their implications in the American states. These data will include policy documents produced by government, such as legislative bills, as well as commonly-used derivative measures. In addition, the F-DASH will promote innovation in complex database design and provide an extensive test-bed for researchers interested in text mining, large-scale relational databases, static and dynamic network analysis, and many other topics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The multitude of diverse COVID-19-related data streams, which are rapidly made available online with little coordination or reliance on common standards, creates enormous challenges for researchers trying to answer such questions today, and analyze and predict patterns of the pandemic in its cross-disciplinary complexity. This project will do so by linking diverse information about pathogens, health data, and environmental indicators into a common knowledge graph, to let researchers trace the virus in different geographic conditions and provide input into effective intervention policies. <br/><br/>The core technical component of the project is a COVID-19 knowledge graph, which represents linked facts about different aspects of the pandemic, from scientific literature and large data collections and models. The project will develop a novel methodology for creating a knowledge graph from disparate sources describing pathogens, population health, environmental conditions, and critical infrastructure components. The graph will be created in coordination with several partner projects working on the NSF Open Knowledge Network. This will ensure that additional knowledge domains can be integrated to support cross-disciplinary analysis. The results of the collaborative knowledge network development will be published as a continuously updated online dashboard for the general public and a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, open source software to enable interactive computing, to help researchers explore various aspects of the knowledge graph and improve our understanding of how the virus is spread and what intervention strategies are potentially most effective.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first project goal is to build a system of public data on Internet structure, as manifested in the naming, addressing, and routing systems, which will address an increasing gap in science, security, and public communications policy. The project's approach involves cutting edge Internet measurement and analytic tools, crucial operational network engineering expertise required for sound interpretations of the measurements, new methodologies to synthesize different sources of data, and technology to responsibly manage data integrity, availability, and privacy. The second project goal is to establish and sustain an open knowledge network that will use this system of internet structure data to analyze and report on the extent of persistent Internet insecurities and progress in mitigating them, in a form that is understandable by non-technical users, including policy-makers and a wide range of public and private stakeholders. The knowledge network effort will include producing tutorial material that provide insights into the current state of the Internet, the underlying causes of persistent insecurity, and possible paths to a more secure future. The initial list of collaborators spans a range of disciplines that rely on Internet measurement -- from network science to security to economics to law and public policy, and the team will develop more partners during this phase I effort.  <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and use of new tools and methods for the collection, curation, and analysis of massive datasets that capture the current structure of the Internet. These datasets, which include data about interconnection topology, ownership, and economic relationships between networks, and the structure and dependencies of the Internet's Domain Name System, are each complex and unwieldy datasets. The primary intellectual contribution of this project is to encode and process these data such that non-technical people can make useful queries about the datasets, and more technical users can correlate and analyze the information across the datasets. This project will require advances in data tagging, coding, and implementation of cross-dataset queries with sufficient performance to enable interactive investigation. In the past, many such datasets have been maintained on purpose-built platforms, but a significant advance of this project will be an exploration of the feasibility of moving various data items into cloud storage, which will reduce development costs and reduce the complexity of sustaining the effort over time. Therefore an additional outcome of this project will be guidelines and operating practices for the use of cloud services for this type of research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The initial efforts will provide research tools that address national concerns such as health; re-use and study of data that the public has already funded through federally awarded grants; and improving training in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine.  The team includes partnerships with researchers from biomedical, social, geo-science, and climate science fields and integrates extensive expertise from data cyberinfrastructure efforts including: DataMed, a biomedical discovery index previously funded by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge initiative; Data Discovery Studio, a geoscience discovery index funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF); and Pangeo, a climate science discovery and integration platform funded by NSF and NASA.  During Phase I, the project will develop a prototype search engine, called KONQUER (Knowledge Open Network Queries for Research) that will connect these disparate data types and facilitate queries across the integrated datasets. The initial focus of the project is on biomedical, geological, and climate science fields; however, the technology can be extended to cover other scientific disciplines in the future.<br/> <br/>Technological advancements have generated a large volume of data, but finding and analyzing those data in meaningful ways is often challenging.  Real-world scientific questions cross multiple fields.  For example, ""Did the precipitation levels in California's Central Valley in 2016 cause an increase in the number of Valley fever cases?""  To answer this question, requires data from health care, geolocation, and climate science.  However, researchers are traditionally trained in only one field and are not familiar with the data resources of other disciplines, and even when they are aware of other data sources, the data may be structured very differently, all of which slows the process of discovery. KONQUER is envisioned to be a data discovery index capable of integrating various scientific fields and will use natural language processing tools (like a Google search) to decompose questions and retrieve information from the relevant data sources.  To achieve this goal the project team will extend the DATS (DAta Tag Suite) metadata format so that geo/climate and science/biomedical datasets can be indexed in compatible formats, develop a pipeline for automated indexing, and develop a search engine that can query and rank the indexed data. The resulting KONQUER tool will accelerate and transform research and information retrieval so that new hypotheses and discoveries are possible across disciplinary boundaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Floods impact a series of interconnected urban systems ? the Urban Multiplex, that include the power grid and transportation network, surface water and groundwater, sewerage and drinking water systems, inland navigation and dams, all of which are intertwined with the socioeconomic and public health sectors. This project uses a convergent approach to integrate these multiple interconnected systems and merges state-of-the-art practices in hydrological and hydraulic engineering; systems analysis, optimization and control; machine learning, data and computer science; epidemiology; socioeconomics; and transportation and electrical engineering to develop an Urban Flood Open Knowledge Network (OKN), the final deliverable of the project. It will be built with unprecedented engagement between urban domain and flooding experts, practitioners, scientists, and technology specialists. This partnership includes universities, nonprofits, private companies, national labs, federal agencies, states, counties and municipalities across the country. The Urban Flood-OKN will empower decision makers and the general public by providing information on how much flooding may occur from a future event and will also show its cascading impact on natural and engineered infrastructures of an urban area. <br/><br/>The convergence research and development team supporting this effort has integrated researchers and methods from across disciplines including civil and environmental engineering, hydrology, geography, computer science, meteorology, public safety, emergency response, and economics. The partners engaged as advisors, potential users, and developers include more than a dozen municipalities and water management districts, federal agencies (NOAA, USDOT, NIST, USGS, EPA, FEMA), a national lab (PNNL), non-profits (Consortium of Ocean Leadership, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science), for-profit organizations, consortia, and individuals.  <br/><br/>The real impact of flooding on the Urban Multiplex is currently very difficult to quantify because many of its systems are independently designed and managed. Hence an open knowledge network that captures the interconnectedness of these systems and how they impact each other is critically needed. This project will semantically link the Urban Multiplex, whose subsystems generate data that are currently not interoperable. This will enable meaningful queries on flood-related information relevant to urban sustainability. The Urban Flood-OKN will help increase urban resilience and minimize damage from future urban floods due to changing climate and changing land use patterns. It will allow identification of early-warning signals of critical transitions/shifts of a complex interdependent infrastructure system responding to external pressures, and how shifts will be affected by the structure of the Urban Multiplex and failures propagating across its subsystems. This project also has the potential to bring about a societal transformation in the way practitioners, researchers, and the general public engage with, consume, and act upon information about the potential response of the Urban Multiplex to extreme external pressures. This project will allow internet queries that produce actionable information on what to do during storms and flooding, how to plan long-term, and how these decisions will contribute to urban sustainability and resilience ? all based on solid science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One cannot expect the already overburdened primary data providers to do the extra work needed to make the data more accessible for others to use. Even those who already publish data on their websites often do not have the time to edit/modify the data, for example to apply newly introduced tags, such as Schema.org?s new tags related to coronavirus. Yet, these data are critical in a crisis in order to inform the public; improve emergency response; and aid the scientific community in its efforts to find solutions. Currently, the teams that are engaged in dataset collection are employing slow, tedious, and painstaking manual techniques.  The interactive dataset collection tools to be developed by this project will provide an alternative approach, empowering a community of volunteers to help with data collection efforts. The data collection tools developed can be used with only an internet connection, a web browser, and brief training, thereby putting the effort well within reach of a large population of potential volunteers. <br/><br/>Existing automatic data extractors assume that (i) webpages in a single website are structured uniformly, because they were produced from the same template and (ii) relevant webpages originate from a single website.  As a result, much of the prior work in the area of web data extraction and ingestion focuses on ?syntactic? extraction.  Currently, dedicated data collection teams are collecting data with a combination of expertise and time-consuming and painstaking manual effort.  Other teams are hiring call centers to call hospitals in each state to collect their capacities. Such high-cost, high-effort approaches do not scale well to all the datasets that one would like to be able to access and analyze. Many COVID-19-related datasets are scattered over thousands of websites with similar information but no structural similarities--e.g., each hospital?s website may look different but may contain very similar and related data. The technical challenge that this project will tackle will be to build a ?semantic? data extractor that locates the information of interest despite divergent website structures. The software tools that will be created for data ingestion can be used by the many individuals who are keen to contribute their time and effort to help combat COVID-19, without compromising their physical distancing efforts.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Convergence Accelerator program in the Office of Integrative Activities and is associated with the Convergence Accelerator Track A: Open Knowledge Network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important goal of this workshop is to launch a new Network for Earth-space Research, Education and Innovation with Data (NEREID), to help articulate an actionable, equitable and inclusive path toward Earth and space data science literacy for lifelong learners. In addition, these findings are likely to be transferable to data learning in other disciplines as well.<br/><br/>In support of this, the Associated Universities, Incorporated (AUI) will organize a visioning and capacity-building workshop to develop the Network for Earth-space Research, Education and Innovation with Data to support large-scale convergence efforts in Earth-Space sciences. NEREID will include members from academia, industry and research communities. It will have the goal of engaging learners as well as policymakers in topics related to Earth-Space sciences and will build a community of practice around the use of data and related tools. The workshop will bring together a variety of stakeholders in order to build an interdisciplinary community of practice in Earth-Space data science learning and practice. Such a community would help develop and disseminate best practices and curricular resources in teaching and learning with Earth-space data; elicit diverse points of view and enfranchise underrepresented groups; identify knowledge and policy gaps and develop strategies that will more effectively address those gaps; and conceptualize a related NSF Convergence Accelerator activity<br/><br/>The NEREID workshop will help define the kinds of research, resources, data and tools that are best suited to building convergence around space and Earth data and will begin to lay out the design for the advancement of that work. The workshop will produce a white paper and roadmap articulating the feasibility for applying data science to advancing the important NSF priorities in Earth and space sciences. It will address gaps in understanding and gaps in processes for better advancing the convergence of scientific knowledge across these disciplines, focusing especially on learning communities.

The developed AI technology will allow personalized training techniques to be ported to the emerging jobs. Specifically, the personalized training and assessment generation can be used across workers with various backgrounds and areas, focusing only on what workers need to learn, skipping what they have already mastered, which can cut training time dramatically while boosting knowledge and skill acquisition, build workers self-awareness and self-confidence, and ensure the fair treatment of workers. Whilst the immediate test beds are in mining, metal processing and manufacturing, which take advantage of existing core education and research strengths and our industrial consortia and stakeholder industries, the impact of the tools can be tailored for other fields in engineering. Through the multidisciplinary cooperation across academia, industry, and education fields, this project will enhance the scientific understanding of future worker training and forms a pedagogical convergence of AI techniques, educational sciences, and traditional engineering & sciences, which meet the future interdisciplinary job requirements. <br/><br/>This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project will replicate personalized tutoring methods with an AI-enabled approach that will allow for automatic assessment of the skills and gaps for displaced workers and for fast, fair, and cost-effective training at scale to place them in new jobs.

There is a multiplier effect on job growth in the national economy through expansions in manufacturing.  As jobs and skills change and evolve, retraining and upskilling will become necessary steps towards economic sustainability, more importantly so as we recover during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The aim of the SkillXR platform is to disrupt current modes of workforce development by eliminating the current need for expensive software development and consulting intermediaries to create and maintain augmented, virtual and mixed reality (XR) applications.  Through our partnerships within the small and large manufacturing industry and workforce education, we will transition the future workforce from acquisition of apprenticeships to real-world profitable skills in emerging industries over the next decade. Our focused partnerships with small businesses, minority entrepreneurs, play museums, and rural education promotes equitable access. The general-purpose nature of SkillXR will amplify the impact beyond our initial planned manufacturing education area to become ubiquitous across many other fields including robotics, construction, plant operations, education, and eventually everyday spatial cognitive assistance. Our pre-upskilling and learning analytics platform is planned to impact tens of thousands in five to six years and millions within a decade. Rural communities especially will benefit, as manufacturing represents twice the amount of earnings there, versus non-rural areas.<br/><br/>The highly interdisciplinary team brings knowledge spanning manufacturing, computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI), spatial interfaces and interactions, learning sciences, learning analytics, cognitive psychology, and visual gamified interfaces. We will collaborate closely with key partners using a design-research driven convergence framework to develop and transform research-based prototypes into products and services to impact our skilled workforce and economy. The two sides of our emerging product platform will (1) enable the authoring of AI-based XR personalized training applications by subject matter experts (coaches, teachers, trainers), without the need for prior knowledge in programming or sophisticated applications, and (2) a low-cost AI-based hardware approach to get personalized user analytics of tasks ?on-the-job? for scalable workforce assessment and optimization. Our approach permits extreme flexibility for various industrial use cases, reusability through plug-and-play for millions of applications, as well as tracking end-user spatial and performance analytics across time. By combining both basic and applied research our team will develop several high-fidelity collaborative cloud-based architectures, and a series of reconfigurable and widely applicable workflows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The US litigation system is the primary mechanism through which our laws are formally enforced. Understanding how effectively the litigation system operates is critical to maintaining public trust, which is one reason why the courts maintain detailed records of all federal litigation.<br/><br/>Development of the proposed Northwestern Open Access to Court Records Initiative (NOACRI) open resource brings together legal scholars, criminologist, sociologists, computer scientists, statisticians, and complexity scholars to build a unique open knowledge network that will enable the convergence of a broad range of diverse communities--including legal scholars, social scientists, economists, journalists, and public policy stakeholders to more systematically study the federal legal system. NOACRI proposes to enable both analytically savvy and inexperienced users to interrogate the court data assembled. The project proposes to create unparalleled access to both raw case data and data annotations, including data annotated by the project team and data that are community-annotated. This more accessible data should also enable development of machine-learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to study court data systematically.<br/> <br/>This project proposes to expand the substantial scholarly potential of court records by bringing recent methodological advances in big data analytics to bear on the field of legal research. To date, researchers have, by necessity, tended to focus primarily on the text of judicial opinions. This project will create an open and free resource of public litigation data, linked to supplementary publicly available data, that will dramatically advance the quantitative understanding of the workings of the federal court system. Importantly, it seeks to make visible and measurable data on cases that are settled or dismissed. Settled and dismissed cases may constitute well over half of federal court activity but is rarely published on court websites or otherwise available for free, limiting systematic study. This research will also aid in the development of data federation standards and natural language querying approaches that will benefit researchers in other subject areas that have a similar need to extract systematic insights from text.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Automation is splitting the American labor force into two worlds: a relatively small number of highly educated professionals earning good wages, and less-educated workers who are left with businesses that pay low wages. Although we have had technology breakthroughs, the overall productivity growth is slow partly due to a workforce that lacks critical new competencies, such as procedural instruction learning, digital fluency, and other essential skills. The current and future workforce needs to be geared up for a culture of constant change. Companies have been relying on the age-old way of one-on-one Worker Apprenticeship model to train their new workforce. However, the recent need for larger scale and rapid training has created a bottleneck in terms of time and cost, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This research team comprising of mechanical and electrical engineers, psychologists, computer scientists, and education researchers will work toward accomplishing a goal of creating a scalable low-cost solution for (re)skilling the workforce. <br/> <br/>In order to address this (re)skilling challenge, we propose to emulate the worker apprenticeship and develop a new low-cost and flexible way for SMEs themselves to author in Augmented Reality (AR). By overlaying digital content over the physical world we will address issues of worker training that SMEs continue to face. We plan to break down the problem of worker (re)skilling into three categories: Authoring: knowledge transfer, Training-Learning: system scaling for consumption, and Feedback: providing active feedback to users. AR has shown to be a reliable mode of instructional training, improving speed and reliability, minimizing errors, and reducing the cognitive load of the user, especially for spatially situated instructions. SMEs are often unaware, reluctant, and lack access because of the high overhead costs, unknown returns, and lack of expertise involved in designing, creating, and maintaining the AR content for the success of this technology. We propose to develop technologies which enable experts in the SMEs to create content on their own and provide a smooth transfer of knowledge. The ease of creation of AR, and elimination of dependency on programming experts, will translate to a reduction in AR development time and cost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results could accelerate the changes of traditional training programs to new types of training and certification related to the latest technology advances. Specifically, this project will benefit firefighters with a new training platform that reduces injuries, shortens training process, and prepares more people as future firefighters with virtual training programs. This will save lives and reduce costs of both property damage and human casualty in fires. With the developed platform that will be made publicly available, firefighters will learn STEM skills and achieve an easy transition into new positions that require similar skills in later in their careers.

The SCALES OKN seeks to create the computational and data science tools needed to democratize access to court records. Greater access to court records and analysis tools will enable policy makers, scholars, journalists, entrepreneurs, and the public to directly engage with and evaluate the workings of the U.S. courts. <br/><br/>The U.S. court system collects detailed data about their activities, but the challenge is that most of this data sits behind paywalls and in scattered systems that are difficult to access. Highly limited access means that court records are functionally inaccessible to the public. This limited access to court records has prevented the development of tools to turn court data into information and insights. The SCALES OKN will develop aggregation and analysis tools that will bring together a community of public servants, academic institutions, non-profits, private organizations, and individuals to better understanding how litigation proceeds. Access to these new data and analysis tools will enable legal scholars to better analyze litigation processes, entrepreneurs to assess litigation costs and risk, journalists to investigate equity in outcomes, advocacy organizations assess public policy needs, and the public to better understand how the modern judiciary functions.<br/><br/>This project joins 22 scholars in computer and data science, economics, journalism, law, and sociology from eight universities with a large and diverse range of partners from non-profit and for-profit organizations. The SCALES OKN?s existing partnerships will enable users to ask questions such as how lawsuits involving Fortune 500 companies or with representation from large law firms progress, or if judicial rules are consistently implemented. As the project develops, additional data and tools will enable an even richer view into topics such as how new laws impact the judiciary, corporations, and individuals, or how a changing economic climate impacts people and organizations?whether that be because of a global economic downturn or changes to the nature of employment as impacts from the COVID-19 epidemic unfold.<br/><br/>This team is building SCALES OKN as an open and freely accessible knowledge network. Their efforts include developing the tools to transform the data that define court records into actionable information. This work will include the development of tools to extract and transform data from court records, resolve and disambiguate entities, and enable the automated identification of litigation events and construction of a lawsuit?s lifecycle. Rather than having users depend on their own data skills, the SCALES efforts plan to map user information requests onto the analyses needed to address questions of relationships, correlations, trends, and distributions of actions and decisions in the legal system. The team also plans to build tools that facilitate the continued growth of open knowledge networks through public contributions.

To accomplish this, the Competency Catalyst has two major deliverables. The first is an application called ""Skillsync"" that enables companies to communicate specific reskilling needs and helps colleges respond with accelerated programs that target them. The second is a ?C2 platform? that describes and aligns job requirements and reskilling opportunities in terms of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). Skillsync is built on the C2 platform and replaces existing manual processes with direct, real-time communication between human resource departments and college programs. Skillsync will immediately improve the ability of companies to reskill their workforce, while the C2 platform will catalyze and support a larger ecosystem of workforce-related applications, including other Convergence Accelerator projects and national efforts focused on improving the talent pipeline. Skillsync and the C2 platform will be designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of learning technologists, AI researchers, education and workforce development professionals, open data architects, and experts in competency-based training.  Skillsync will be piloted with multiple company-college pairs to upskill a diverse population of workers. After completing the pilots, the Competency Catalyst team plans to maintain the C2 platform as a public good, and to offer Skillsync as a subscription service paid for by companies and free to colleges. <br/><br/>The Competency Catalyst will build on multiple enabling technologies, including (a) the Jill Watson AI-based conversational assistant from the Georgia Institute of Technology; (b) the Credential Engine?s open data infrastructure; and (c) digital competency extraction tools and the open-source Competency and Skills System (CaSS) developed by Eduworks. The development approach will include participatory research, human-centered design, rapid prototyping, and pilot testing. The C2 platform will programmatically ingest data from national sources and apply recent natural language understanding and machine learning methods to represent these data as structured sets of KSAs with relations and links to external resources. In Skillsync, these can be edited and ordered by importance to represent company needs. The C2 platform will offer an open alignment score service that Skillsync will use to analyze matches between desired KSAs and available educational and training resources. In addition, Skillsync users will be able to engage with Jill Watson to better understand how colleges view the skills that learners acquire. This will assist companies in defining their needs in terms that are meaningful to college partners.  Equity and bias issues will be considered throughout the design and development of the Skillsync and the C2 platform, including issues such as bias and fairness in AI and machine-learned models. The project will also research the relative contributions of AI, enhanced digital communication, and socio-technological behavioral change to improving company-college reskilling partnerships.

Together, we will unlock the power of administrative data, science, and technology to support American workers with effective reskilling programs for a changing work landscape. Our project relies on the convergence and combined strengths of computer science, economics, education, public policy, behavioral science, and applied finance. First, we will create scientifically-valid return on investment measures for publicly-funded labor training programs. This information will then be available to government and all workers through a public API and web tool. The tool, which will be launched and usable by 2022, will help government understand the returns to training programs and alternatives to higher education; empower workers to make informed decisions about their future; and incentivize training programs to add value to their enrollees' ability to find gainful employment today and in the future.<br/> <br/>This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project will address the fact that, although tens of millions of workers may be displaced and need to reskill in the coming decades, government currently has few measures to guide training investment decisions, ensure that training delivers valuable reskilling and improved outcomes, or help workers choose programs based on return on investment for the future. To meet growing needs and successfully support American workers for the jobs of the future, labor training programs will need to be effective and efficient, delivering measurable success. Retrospective studies have used administrative data to evaluate isolated training programs. However, they cannot guide displaced workers currently seeking training, and do not incentivize program improvement. We will advance scientific knowledge and help workers prepare for careers of the future by combining administrative data with causal machine-learning and econometric methods to deliver scientifically-valid measures of labor training program success in collaboration with state and local government partners.

Health disparities, major public health issues, drug discovery complexity, and overall costs continue to grow dramatically. The mechanisms underlying human health are so complex that the human brain cannot integrate the ever-growing body of available knowledge relevant to treating patients or discovering therapies. This hampers the generation of new knowledge, specifically in the biomedical sciences and its implications for human health. The goal of this project, a biomedical open knowledge network (OKN), is to integrate billions of biomedical concepts into a knowledge engine that will enable doctors, drug developers, researchers, and citizen scientists to produce biologically meaningful answers to biomedical questions ? rapidly and cheaply. This OKN will incorporate billions of factual relationships among biomedical concepts, allowing specialists to generalists to explore biomedicine in its whole might.<br/><br/>The team supported by this project is part of a group pioneering the paradigm of knowledge networks in biomedicine. The effort brings together partners with expertise in search tools (including Google), graph theory (from Lawrence Livermore National Labs), and collaboration with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences? Biomedical Data Translator (part of the National Institutes of Health), as well as working with other academic nonprofit institutions (the Institute for Systems Biology, Indiana University, UC San Diego, and Stanford. The ambitious effort represents convergence research including expertise across all aspects of biomedicine and data science, integrating doctors, researchers, epistemologists, database specialists, computer scientists, and statisticians.<br/><br/>During Phase I of the Convergence Accelerator Program, the team developed and made available a fully functional biomedical knowledge network, the Scalable Precision Medicine Knowledge Engine (SPOKE, spoke.rbvi.ucsf.edu). This success supports the likelihood that the team will produce deliverables in this Phase II project that will have a positive impact on society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Academic researchers, core-technology developers, stakeholders, and an advisory board constituted of leaders from industry and government will come together to assess opportunities and challenges related to the use of human augmentation technologies (HATs) that can transform the process of foundational, use-inspired solution-finding for ER work, and in a way that is transferable to other work contexts as well. This will involve the development and evaluation of LEARNER (Learning Environments with Augmentation and Robotics for Next-gen Emergency Responders), a mixed-reality learning environment with physical, augmented, and virtual reality components, for users to learn to work effectively with two HAT classes: powered exoskeletons (EXO) and head-worn AR interfaces (AR). Our effort will contribute to better conceptualize convergence work that can foster the understanding of reciprocal human-technology interactions; contribute to systems that are tailored, optimized, and continuously adapted for humans and their environments; and education and lifelong learning to create the requisite workforce. Our effort will also serve as a model for other research communities that can benefit from working across traditional disciplinary boundaries in engineering, computer science, learning sciences, and human resource development. We will share our methods, learnings and findings with the ER community and the wider world by leading a National Talent Ecosystem Council, a collaborative think-tank organization, to support scientific research activities on workforce learning with advanced technologies and organizing Learn-X symposiums on the topic of technology-driven advances in learning-sciences and educational/human resource development.<br/><br/>We will develop and evaluate a functional prototype of LEARNER ? an innovative accessible, modular, personalized, and scalable learning platform to accelerate skilling and reskilling of ER workers, particularly on nascent augmentation technologies that have significant potential to change the very nature of work and improve efficiency, health, and well-being.

""Space weather"" is the colloquial term used to describe the conditions and variability of the near-Earth space environment and its tangible impacts on technology, including critical infrastructure like the power grid, satellite services, navigation and communication systems. <br/><br/>In Phase I, this project will focus on one of the most important and immediate impacts of space weather disturbances: disruptive and potentially catastrophic induced currents in the electric power grid known as geomagnetically induced currents (GICs); however, the outcomes will be more broad, providing a foundation for the growth of a space weather Open Knowledge Network in which new data providers can join and become a node in the network. The project intends to embrace a diverse community: diverse in discipline, in sector of society (i.e., across academia, industry, and the public sector), and in representation, and propose to adopt an ethos of 'open by default' by facilitating broad participation in this work through open source efforts and community engagement. The outcome will be extended capabilities of existing data resources, robust and efficient approaches to answering important research questions, and a practical framework to capture and access knowledge - each of which will be freely available. The experience gained through the project activities will provide lessons learned that will be used to help create a newly capable data literate workforce.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this work will be to respond to three barriers that stand in the way of an understanding of space weather impact on the power grid commensurate with society's needs: (1) the lack of a cohesive community, due to the wide variety of subject matter experts working on topics related in various ways to space weather, (2) the lack of effective data sharing, coordination, and analysis (e.g., data science) to leverage existing resources and knowledge efficiently; and (3) the diversity of physically dominant processes in each section of the space weather environment, making it difficult to relate various models and observations. The Convergence Hub for the Exploration of Space Science (CHESS) plans to create new modes of data-driven discovery. The power grid will serve as a valuable first use case to cultivate a convergent community of space scientists, geophysicists, data scientists, and the industries most affected by space weather.

Citizens and policy makers need knowledge-based, data-driven responses to these massive disruptions of the transportation sector in order for the U.S. to be at the forefront of technological advances and to be able to provide equitable access to transportation. We propose to create an open knowledge network (OKN) for transportation and the emerging mobility ecosystem that leverages and links existing publicly available data (i.e.  www.data.gov). To do this, we will integrate perspectives and insights from engineering, computer science, statistics, social and behavioral science, systems science and public policy. Our transdisciplinary, convergence team is a partnership between public, private and the not-for-profit sectors. The resulting knowledge network will result in better public policy decisions on the deployment of driverless vehicles, sustainable urban planning practices, and more equitable transportation systems design. Data deliverables from the project will empower our project partners and end users to develop innovation ecosystems specific to their local needs and populations of interest. <br/> <br/>With the deployment of innovative transportation technologies such as driverless vehicles on the horizon, we need a more thorough and broader understanding of their potential economic and quality of life impacts.

The project will develop software tools to help in the creation of ""auxiliary"" databases with high-quality data to assist in making better decisions, avoiding fraud, and yielding high-quality analysis sooner in the urgent and rapidly evolving situation created by the coronavirus pandemic. The techniques that will be used to achieve high-quality include:<br/><br/>(1) linking ""background data"" to the data sets to enable quality-checking and fraud detection. For example, ensuring that hospital information listed in the medical resource database is annotated with an accurate phone number so that a volunteer can contact the hospital and check on the accuracy of the data, and <br/><br/>(2) creating new ""join keys"" to enable easy integration of data in the auxiliary database with other data. The project will work closely with other related COVID-19 RAPID efforts which are working on various aspects of data and information collection from the Web.<br/><br/>The project will focus on creating two high-quality databases using these strategies: <br/><br/>(1) A unified medical institution auxiliary database, which will be a database of all known US medical institutions and <br/>(2) A unified government office auxiliary database, which will be a database of all known government offices in the United States?city halls, courts, licensing offices, etc.?at any level of government. <br/><br/>Both these data sets are crucial for ensuring that citizens receive a base level of medical aid and government assistance. These resources would be beneficial not only for this particular pandemic, but would become essential resources, in general, for the future. <br/><br/>The proposed auxiliary data set creation infrastructure will include a rich schema of background information, used for quality-checking, and a set of join keys for data integration. While there is a huge array of medical institution data sets online, many of the data sets are misaligned due to lack of standard names and/or data integration keys since different projects make different local decisions in choosing these values that may not be universally compatible. As a result, the background information becomes less rich and makes integration with data from other institutions or analysis pipelines much more difficult. The strategies used to create this infrastructure would include: <br/><br/>(1) synthesis of preliminary auxiliary datasets, which includes generating common, candidate attributes for all objects in the input set, for example, creating a helipad field for hospitals based on examining all hospital data in Wikidata; <br/>(2) identification of inputs with missing values, and filling in those values with a combination of Web extraction tasks and crowdsourcing tasks, and <br/>(3) flagging values that are suspected of being incorrect by, for example, automatically creating a set of machine-learned predictors for each column in the auxiliary data.

Today's knowledge networks, for example Wikidata, include high-quality structured information about a very wide range of topics. Knowledge networks make many new and compelling applications possible, such as structured search engine results and voice assistants. Unfortunately, today's knowledge networks and applications have been very difficult and expensive to construct, making it extremely burdensome to create them for novel topics. This project will take advantage of the research team's expertise in data management, artificial intelligence, and economics to create a combination of software and data that should make novel knowledge network systems dramatically easier to produce. The first effort will be an Economics-focused integrated knowledge network-and-tool system, which has the potential to dramatically improve the ease of performing higher-quality economic measurement and analysis. This knowledge network tool can improve economic-oriented research efforts that will benefit national prosperity. However, the even greater value of the effort will be a tool that allows knowledge networks on any topic to be developed more easily and with less programming expertise. <br/><br/>Although knowledge networks are thought to be key to future data-enabled discovery, knowledge network-driven applications have generally not been developed using a reproducible system. This project will begin to build a knowledge application development system that should make knowledge applications easier to write, existing knowledge networks easier to improve, and entirely novel knowledge networks easier to construct. The team's effort is based on a novel and extremely succinct form of programming that they have developed that allows simultaneous programming and extraction of relevant information to contribute to a knowledge network. The proposed simultaneous programming and extraction system will help construct knowledge networks, but will also improve knowledge network data quality, by providing additional weak supervision for the information extraction pipelines that are commonly used to produce the networks. The system will be tested on real data and users in the Economics domain. However, the methods and tools will not be topic-specific, but rather should be widely applicable to knowledge networks in many topical domains.

The planned title is Landscape Carbon Sequestration for Atmospheric Recovery (LCSAR) workshop which will be held in fall 2019 at the University of Oregon. <br/><br/>The event will be designed to stimulate the development of new tools to quantify and accelerate CO2 drawdown through natural climate solutions by catalyzing data integration in alignment with industry and land stewardship needs across forestry, farming, ranching, and wetlands/blue carbon sectors. Research has established that conservation, restoration, and management that increase carbon storage across forests, wetlands, grasslands, agriculture and developed lands, can mitigate impacts of CO2 build up in the Earth's atmosphere. However, critical gaps remain in translating this knowledge to implementation. To advance the natural CO2 sequestration solutions that are sought, public and private-sector land stewards require more detailed recommendations, including cost-benefit analyses, protocols, and technologies that can precisely synthesize data to help prioritize opportunities that are most likely to maximize investment returns. The planned workshop has the potential to accelerate innovation and convergence between private and public sectors to provide carbon drawdown while achieving co-benefits for economic well-being, biodiversity and natural resource conservation. Outcomes may include new prototypes and platform ideas to catalyze investments toward carbon sequestering landscape-based enterprises.<br/><br/>The LCSAR workshop will convene leaders from business, science, the public sector, and key non-profits to assess and synthesize these needs, including: (i) academic experts in carbon sequestration, land systems, and social sciences, (ii) industry stakeholders in forestry, agriculture, livestock, and development (iii) federal, tribal, state, and local land management agencies, (iv) land trusts and private landowners, and (v) technology companies and software engineers engaged in developing non-proprietary knowledge infrastructures. The removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is limited by laws of physics and ecological processes. Natural rates of net carbon uptake are slow compared to the rates and amounts of carbon dioxide released by anthropogenic activity. Emerging scientific data show the need for development and coordination of strategies to address a national need to remove meaningful quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere to the land. The LCSAR workshop will stimulate the use of existing data from NSF-funded networks and other landscape-based research efforts to create an actionable set of protocols and deliverables envisioned via robust multi-institutional partnerships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The phase I effort will begin with expert and stakeholder-driven identification of energy data needs, data development opportunities, methods, and priorities that culminates in a Phase 2 implementation plan for creating a Global Energy Data Commons (GEDC). The planned GEDC will enable researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to access open energy information with much greater data availability and interoperability, allowing significantly more effective decision-making.  <br/><br/>The core project team represents a convergence of diverse disciplines including engineering, economics, machine learning, and energy policy and will establish an expert stakeholder working group to collaborate on identifying priority focus areas for the GEDC (and the wider scientific community) that can be rapidly catalyzed for short-term impact. The GEDC platform is intended to (1) inform an energy data research agenda that is driven by user-demand and real-world problems; (2) improve data interoperability and establish a closely coordinated research network; and (3) make energy data more usable to diverse disciplines through curated, centralized databases, online tools, and visualizations. The GEDC will be open to the public and will enable access and exploration of data in multiple formats (tabular, geospatial, etc.). Finally, this project will also contribute to graduate and post-graduate research training through student and postdoctoral engagement. <br/><br/>The energy system presents significant challenges in data availability and interoperability that limit the ability of stakeholders in academia, non-profits, industry, and government to plan effectively.

This project will create the ?KnowWhereGraph? ? a knowledge graph tool that specifically enables other data-analysis knowledge tools that have a geospatial component. <br/><br/>GeoEnrichment describes the process by which data becomes augmented with a wide range of auxiliary information tailored to a geospatial study area (such as demographic data). GeoEnrichment tools significantly reduce the costs involved in acquiring, entering, and cleaning geo-data. Unfortunately, currently available geoenrichment services provide access to only pre-defined categories of information, do not effectively handle interconnected data, offer limited support for data integration, and are generally expensive. This project plans to make data-driven decision making and data analytics substantially more effective, accessible, and affordable. The project will merge novel Artificial Intelligence-based geoenrichment technologies with a knowledge graph that brings together open, cross-domain, densely integrated data spanning the human-environment interface. <br/><br/>This project?s work is enabled by an open, freely usable knowledge graph. These graphs are a combination of scalable, Web-standard technologies, specifications, and data cultures for representing densely interconnected statements derived from structured or unstructured data across domains, in both human and machine-readable ways. The technology tools are designed to be useful to and useable by researchers, analysts, decision-makers, and the interested public in any domain or cross-domain activity requiring geospatial intelligence. <br/><br/>This project includes strong partnerships with non-academic and academic stakeholders including 4 for-profit organizations, 2 government agencies, and one non-profit, as well as five academic partnerships:  ESRI (Geographic Information Systems); Oliver Wyman, (commodity markets and supply chains), Princeton Climate Analytics (weather and climate information services), In10T (digital agriculture, farm partnerships); US Geological Survey (USGS), Natural Resources Conservation Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): and DirectRelief (humanitarian aid); as well as University of California Santa Barbara(UCSB), Kansas State University (K-State), Michigan State University (MSU), Arizona State University (ASU), and University of Southern California(USC). Additional partnerships are expected to develop during this Phase II effort. <br/><br/>The ?KnowWhereGraph? will be a valuable element of the Convergence Accelerator Phase II cohort, providing geospatial tools to the other projects within the cohort. In addition the project plans to focus on several strategic application areas that are likely to benefit US society, including:  COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions and the US food, agriculture, and energy sectors, and their attendant supply chains generally; environmental policy issues relative to interactions among agricultural sustainability, soil conservation practice, and farm labor; and delivery of emergency humanitarian aid, within the US and internationally. Anytime knowing ?where? is key, this project?s tools may be helpful. <br/><br/>Formally, a knowledge graph consists of a massive set of statements, constructed from inter-connected node- and edge-labeled resources, allowing multiple, heterogeneous edges for the same nodes. A collection of definitional statements specifying the meaning of the knowledge graph's vocabulary is called its (KG) schema or ontology. The ontology is critical for rigorous logical interpretation and machine-actionability. Several innovations in knowledge graph technology will drive the project: (I) creating an open, web-accessible knowledge graph, with attendant methods and tools, to enable contributions to the graph from a range of sources; (II) developing strategies for semantically lifting imagery data, such as remotely sensed imagery and drone imagery, into this graph, thereby integrating vast amounts of data; (III) developing novel spatially-explicit AI-based methods, models, and services to enable geoenrichment on top of this graph; and (IV) developing both programmatic (application program interface, API) and human-accessible interfaces for the KnowWhereGraph. By merging the flexibility, expressive power, and community-driven features of open graph technologies with multi-format geospatial data and advanced geospatial intelligence, the KnowWhereGraph is designed to become a rich, integrative information resource that can transform and converge discovery, analysis, and synthesis within and across a multitude of fields and sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HCQ may provide a treatment option for COVID-19; however, the pandemic already appears to be disrupting the global pharmaceutical supply, which may cause shortages of this and other important medicines in the United States. Shortages of medicines occur in part because the domestic drug supply chain has become longer, more complex, and fragmented. The United States has sophisticated chemicals and pharmaceutical manufacturing capability, but many key raw materials and/or intermediates are manufactured elsewhere in the world. Less complicated markets could respond to a shortage by increasing production, but logistical challenges ? especially the complexity of the supply chain ? limit the ability of domestic drug manufacturers to easily increase production. Although the United States ranks second in global chemicals exports, much of its manufacturing capacity is unable to be readily leveraged to address anticipated shortfalls because there is no clear map of production requirements or domestic manufacturing capacity that is capable of meeting these requirements. HCQ will be ?mapped? as an example case, with the potential to refine and apply the same methodology even more rapidly to other compounds of value to the public in treating COVID-19 or for application to other diseases or emergent challenges. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a systematic ontology - and more specifically, a knowledge graph ? of HCQ production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in hydroxycloroquine (HCQ). The project plans to start with HCQ, but the methodology should be readily applicable to other molecules such as Remdesivir or Favipiravir (which have also been proposed as potential COVID-19 therapies). In partnership with Procter & Gamble, the project will leverage an Authoritative System Knowledge (ASK) chemical systems approach, as well as data and resources from the ?M-Print? open knowledge network Phase I Convergence Accelerator project (1937017). The ASK methodology is currently used by industry and government organizations to manage electromechanical systems manufacturing and other processes, but tools such as these are not yet widely used in the chemicals industry. The project team hypothesizes that suppliers of necessary source materials and intermediates in the US and abroad can be identified, and more importantly that the chemical transformations required for the HCQ process could be retooled within American facilities if that were a desirable outcome to ensure robust supply. To test the specific hypothesis that US manufacturing of HCQ could be optimized to minimize global supply chain challenges, the team will develop a model approach that uses raw materials available in the U.S., including the production requirements to transform these raw materials into HCQ.

Although staying competitive requires the productivity of US manufacturing to increase with the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous robotics, advanced robotic systems currently require a workforce with, at the least, 4-year degrees in engineering, computer science or AI. The problem is amplified by the fact that current robotics technologies do not inherently support adaptability, safety and explainability. This project will address these issues by creating autonomous on-the-job training platforms that use safe, self-explaining, adaptive robots.  In order to achieve these objectives, our team employs a convergent approach drawing upon ideas and tools from research on intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), AI, robotics, manufacturing processes, human systems engineering, and cognitive science. The project's team also includes experts on resolving legal and socio-ethical challenges of bringing advanced technology to existing social infrastructure.  This project synthesizes these diverse approaches in coordination with multiple industrial partners to enable an autonomous on-the-job training platform that would empower our national workforce for working with autonomous systems. <br/><br/>This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project aims to initiate the invention, development and evaluation of intelligent training systems and self-explaining autonomous systems for providing safe on-the-job training for work with autonomous systems. Although autonomous systems have immense potential for empowering a highly productive workforce, this potential cannot be realized with the current state of the art. Training for work with today's autonomous systems presents unique challenges not addressed by current training paradigms, which are designed for operational systems characterized by fixed functionality and behavior. In contrast, AI systems will, by definition, change from day to day in their functionality and behavior. This interdisciplinary project will utilize safe and taskable self-explaining autonomous systems to develop a new class of intelligent tutoring systems that provide on-the-job training for work with autonomous systems. In the process, it will also advance methods for creating self-explaining autonomous systems, for the automated synthesis of task-specific robot behavior that is safe and compliant with workplace regulations, and for the evaluation of collaborative human-autonomy teamwork. In addition, it will advance research in these areas through the development of reproducible testbeds in consultation with industry experts in the domain of collaborative human-robot advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exchanging career goals, records, credentials, competencies, assessments, job descriptions, and pathways as machine-actionable data will be foundational to realizing this goal. Because the education and employment sectors have many different documentation policies, processes, roles, and governance, this project engages a wide range of experts. The leadership team represents multiple disciplines including education, government, business, computer science, philanthropy, policy, educational psychology, and ethics. Indiana is an ideal context for this research because multiple related initiatives are actively but independently being developed across the state. Phase I activities will build an extensive partner network to document how each initiative's data exchanges can connect in support of particular use cases. Identified data gaps limit the value of these initiatives and will be added to a roadmap for eliminating technical barriers. Similar to how connected data exchanges have rapidly improved the travel industry, we believe state-level governance of key data exchanges will accelerate innovative applications for workers and help other state leaders advance similar initiatives.<br/><br/>This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project focuses on a state-level governance gap concerning the connections among key data exchanges supporting students, education providers, workers, and employers. In Indiana, as in other states, these data exchanges are at varying points of development and adoption.

Technicians will remain critical in the installation and maintenance of advanced manufacturing systems, but they must understand such systems in order to troubleshoot them effectively. Good training is both authentic and consistently deliverable. Achieving this requires coordination between curriculum designers, subject matter experts, educational practitioners, and many other stakeholders. The endeavor has been approached alternately as a ""product design"" problem from the curriculum development perspective, or an ""organizational coordination"" problem from an organizational policy perspective. Our approach connects these two perspectives in a transdisciplinary effort to produce a technical training apparatus that can keep pace with rapid advancement in fields like machine learning and AI.<br/><br/>This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project takes a design research approach to fusing the organizations-inward and product-outward approaches into a single efficient enterprise. Our project employs design and improvement science methods to answer questions about (i) How to design effective and deliverable machine learning (ML) curriculum for technician trainees with little or no STEM background; and (ii) How to design productive collaborative routines around this objective, given the wide variety of stakeholders. We start with a ""shovel-ready"" curriculum concept and an experienced production team that uses human-centered design (HCD) techniques to design usable, pedagogically effective activities. In addition to authorial consultation with AI subject matter experts, HCD involves data collection on instructors, learners, and their extended learning contexts including administrative and social aspects. We problematize collaboration patterns of the production team with other stakeholders during this process, identifying improved routines to accelerate the collaborative's joint work. This phase of the project produces knowledge of how to accelerate curriculum design through enhanced collaborative routines, knowledge of how ML/AI can be integrated into technician training, prototype ML/AI curriculum for non-four-year audiences, and direct training impact for pilot participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is estimated that by 2030 about 14% of the global workforce may need to change occupational categories as the world of work is disrupted by technological advances. Many current workers and those entering the workforce lack skills that in-demand jobs and jobs of the future require. Addressing this challenge requires a holistic understanding of occupational categories and characteristics, their interrelationships and changes over time, worker characteristics, and how to connect workers to future jobs and help them transition from one type of work to another and plan their career pathway. Our project involves convergent research in AI, data science, and optimization, industrial and organizational psychology - specifically, person-job fit, person-environment fit, employee selection and bias, and human resources - specifically, workforce training and career planning. It will leverage partnerships with a diversity of stakeholders:  government organizations, academia, industry, civilian, and military - to inform our research and define objectives and deliverables that are suitable for transitioning to practice.<br/><br/>This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project incorporates three elements to transform decision support for linking workers with future jobs and for job transition, training, and career planning.

This project will develop an Open Knowledge Network (OKN) to advance the transformation from ocean data to ocean information to ocean knowledge, with the goal of producing outcomes that will improve ocean resource decision making and business planning in the face of rapidly changing ocean conditions. Fisheries in the Northeast contributed $7 billion to the regional economy and provided 172,000 jobs in 2016, as well as contributing to the social fabric of coastal communities. This productivity is threatened by the rapid changes underway in the northwest Atlantic ecosystem. This project will produce tangible products that can be used by individuals, businesses, and communities to make better-informed decisions about fisheries resources.  <br/><br/>The proposed Fisheries OKN will support transformative advances in fisheries decision making by integrating data across atmospheric, oceanic, ecosystem, and human dimensions to produce forecasts and conduct scenario testing that can inform near term tactical decisions, medium term strategies, and long-term planning. The project will support a transformation from a reliance on historical observations to forward-looking decision making that considers the rapid changes ecosystems are currently experiencing. The effort relies on data and insights from across the disciplines of oceanography, ecosystem science, climate science, social sciences, and computer science integrated to develop innovative tools and advance knowledge. This effort also requires deep engagement with a range of decision makers including fisheries managers and advisors, fishing industry, and the seafood supply chain to understand their needs and to deliver actionable information. This project seeks to produce fundamental new understanding of how processes in ecosystems, climate and human systems interact. It will also develop new statistical and computational approaches to enhance the impact of publicly-available ecosystem and environmental data on management and business decisions. During Phase I, this project will focus on three areas: 1) convergence team building and integration across disciplines, 2) designing the data infrastructure for the fisheries OKN, and 3) evaluating convergence opportunities in core application areas. This research will add insights to important questions about how individuals and groups of humans transform their decision making in the face of environmental and ecosystem changes, and will develop understanding of the kinds of data, information products, and processes that enable decision making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowledge graphs consist of interlinked pieces of information about our world. By connecting data across different domains, multimedia formats, and perspectives, knowledge graphs enable users to ask more complicated questions and arrive at a more holistic understanding of complex physical and social processes. This project focuses on the tools needed to identify and link space and time for knowledge graphs. These tools are important because everything happens somewhere and at some time and because knowing where and when things happen is critical to understanding why and how they happen. Currently geographic information systems in use in academia, industry, and governments are not yet well integrated with knowledge graphs. This project's highly interdisciplinary team (representing four major universities, three industry partners, and two government agencies) will demonstrate how to develop common models, methods, and services to enable the publication, retrieval, reuse, analysis, and inference of spatial and temporal data for knowledge graphs across domain boundaries. The team plans to will apply the techniques developed to applications such as soil health, hydrology, and urban planning. Expected project results will give domain experts and the broader public free and open access to data and analysis functions that will link otherwise disconnected knowledge about extreme events, soil health, smart farming, and urban planning together. The open knowledge network envisioned in this effort has the potential to provide easier access to knowledge graph data which may improve opportunities for many sectors that rely on connecting to geographic information system data. <br/><br/>Places connect people, entities, and events together and, thus, are a densely interconnected part of all general-purpose knowledge graphs to date. Nonetheless, individual domains have developed their own (often incompatible) ways to represent places as well as space and time more generally. For instance, there is no agreed upon method to spatio-temporally restrict statements such as changing national boundaries. Similarly, established machine-learning techniques used to infer new knowledge graph statements or to summarize existing ones typically ignore spatial and temporal aspects and, thus, fall short of their full potential. Finally, existing efforts cannot handle numerical or multi-modal data such as satellite imagery. The overarching theme of this Phase I project is to reach convergence on how to efficiently represent, retrieve, and analyze the spatial and temporal aspects present in almost all datasets irrespective of the individual disciplines they originate from, resulting in interoperability instead of domain-specific and potentially incompatible solutions. During phase I the team will review state-of-the-art methods, models, and services; harmonize them across domain boundaries; develop spatially and temporally explicit machine-learning methods and tools to better represent, analyze, and infer spatial and temporal data; and provide best practices for other open knowledge networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spatial decision support (SDS) tools are used across a diversity of domains, including public health, emergency management, city planning, education, natural resource management, public safety, transportation, utilities, and the delivery of public and private services more generally. Despite many successful applications, the effectiveness of spatial decision support contributions is limited by challenges in integrating information across complex organizational networks and across an array of data and tools developed for narrow (often discipline-specific) applications. This project will develop technologies and participatory methods that will help bridge organizational and disciplinary boundaries, thereby building a foundation for an open knowledge network for spatial decision support (OKN-SDS). The interdisciplinary project team plans to engage stakeholders in three applied case studies: the management of wildland fire, water quality, and biodiversity conservation. These three use-cases will be used to develop and test participatory and automated methods for structuring, tagging and sharing decision-relevant information. These demonstration projects, the accompanying development of the underlying technical architecture for the OKN-SDS, and outreach to broader SDS-related communities will motivate and facilitate the integration of SDS data and tools that is needed to better address a diverse range of decision-making processes that require spatial decision support.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is based on the participatory and open technology development process that the team will use to develop resources for creating use-inspired spatial decision support applications relevant to challenges in many disciplines.

Such knowledge can often only be gained by intensive study in fields of product engineering or requires extensive research and trial and error. The goal of this project is to make design and product development more accessible by developing a product design and manufacturing knowledge network that links 3-D product model information, including the visual relationships between parts, with underlying meta-data that includes detailed part information and data associated with the manufacturing of the part. A large amount of unstructured, structured, and semi-categorized data will be collected from the web and will be further processed and analyzed using novel geometric deep learning and natural language processing algorithms. The collected data and computational tools will be refined to create a knowledge network that powers design bots that can answer queries and assist design. Ultimately the research community, students, and the general public will obtain access to this open-sourced knowledge network which can help accelerate manufacturing innovation and entrepreneurship.

This system will provide tools to assemble and analyze infrastructure data that can improve evaluation, planning, design, construction, and operation of our infrastructure systems. The project includes a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional team of civil engineering, data science, computer science, and social science experts and leverages industry and government partnerships to identify and harness the necessary data to enable safer, more efficient, and cost-effective construction, operation, and maintenance of U.S. infrastructure. <br/><br/>The CIS-OKN has the potential to transform the way civil infrastructure systems decision-makers and stakeholders interact with and use what were previously isolated and heterogeneous data. The project seeks to improve understanding of the factors contributing to infrastructure deterioration and to help decision-makers select and prioritize the operations necessary to maintain the reliability and improve the sustainability of the U.S. infrastructure system.

Because of this organizational and research efforts are directed toward improving planning, immediate response, and resiliency against natural disasters. However, those efforts are often siloed based on the type of disaster (e.g. wildfires vs. landslides). An additional challenge is understanding and using the explosion of technological capabilities that provide so many new data sources, including physical (e.g., sensors, internet-of-things tools, drones), cyber (e.g., hazard databases, open government data), and social (e.g. microblog streams) data of various modalities (text/images/videos). This workshop will identify areas of future research and inter-organizational collaboration that are needed to transform big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning tools into actionable knowledge for all types of disaster management.  <br/><br/>This workshop will bring together 30-40 stakeholders including practitioners (e.g. first responders, local/state/federal government), academia (including fields of computer, social, physical sciences. and engineering), and industry (for-profit, non-profit) to discuss the information and data technology needs for all phases of disaster resilience, from planning to response to recovery. The workshop will identify major research challenges / opportunities and the potential for the research areas to transition to practical use in the short term. These insights will help describe the potential for this area to serve as a future topic for the NSF Convergence Accelerator. Big data harnessed with artificial intelligence (AI) tools are needed to improve productivity, efficiency, and decision making in disaster preparedness and response, but big data and AI are also relevant to many other challenges our society is facing. Therefore, this workshop should also provide an example of how disparate data and tools may be integrated for planning and decision support. This effort builds upon investments made by other programs at NSF, including Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP), Interdisciplinary Research in Hazards and Disasters (Hazard-SEES), and Smart & Connected Communities (S&CC), as well as investments by many other U.S. federal agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The TOKN project will be executed by a multidisciplinary team of cognitive scientists, machine learning and artificial intelligence engineers, and educators from Rice University's OpenStax and Stanford University who are committed to creating a library of intelligent textbooks, engaging more partners as the project progresses. To begin, this project will build knowledge graphs that capture the complex relationships between educational concepts. A knowledge graph enables artificial intelligence algorithms to provide enhanced and personalized functionality to intelligent textbooks. Consequently, the intelligent textbook can provide more robust courseware functionality (text, videos, simulations, etc.), learning analytics, and personalized tutoring, such as automatically generating summaries of textbook content, generating useful practice exercises for students, providing interactive dialogues with students to help them better understand and master the underlying source material, and more.  Integrating this intelligent technology into the full OpenStax free and open library has the potential to impact academic outcomes for millions of students in both secondary and higher education, while significantly advancing the state of education worldwide. <br/><br/>Intelligent textbooks provide an opportunity to facilitate better learning for students. However, they require major investments of time, money, and expertise. An appropriate knowledge graph is at the heart of an intelligent textbook and is often the biggest challenge to intelligent textbook creation due to the need for human subject experts to develop the semantic connectivity of terms and ideas. TOKN aims to develop new, scalable processes and supporting technologies for generating high-quality and extensible knowledge graphs for intelligent textbooks. The proposed research aims to lower both the cost and time required to produce high-quality knowledge graphs. In contrast to using subject matter experts, this project proposes to use a combination of machine learning algorithms and crowdsourcing of knowledge from students. Crowdsourcing will not only provide data for knowledge graphs, but it will also provide an opportunity to evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness of concept mapping on student learning. Phase 1 of this project will include a proof of concept to construct and validate a knowledge graph for one chapter of OpenStax Biology, a free and open-source text used by more than 30% of students in college biology programs.

An overarching thrust of NSF?s 2019 Convergence Accelerator program is to create an open knowledge network (OKN) and this specific project?s efforts have the potential to improve the development of knowledge networks in any topical domain. The project effort will build upon the team's existing research to enhance a programming tool that will allow people without programming expertise to acquire and use large, complex datasets from the web, so that anyone can contribute to an open knowledge network and help create a shared resource of broad value. <br/><br/>The motivation for the project is the need for researchers, decision-makers, and the public to have access to more thorough and current data, focusing first on data relevant to the broad fields of sociology, public policy, and economics. The project seeks to create tools so that social scientists can enrich an existing OKN containing government datasets with the dynamic view of the world presented by website data. This project will produce programming tools that allow social scientists (or any researcher) to create ontologies and link datasets without extensive programming training. To create a truly open OKN - that can be extended by untrained consumers, data providers, and other non-coders - requires highly learnable programming techniques. This project expands the team's prior advances in the field of learnable programming to build an OKN interface around cutting-edge technologies that merge programming languages, human-computer interaction, and programming-by-demonstration. Concretely, using the tool this project will develop a user will be able to encounter a target dataset on a website, the tool will demonstrate how to collect a small sample of the data, show the user how to annotate the data with its ontology (connections to other terms and ideas), then based on the user's input, the tool will write the program to extract the next trillion data points from the website and enter them into the OKN.  The team also envisions that the tool can then suggest other datasets that may be appropriate to link, and the user can enter into a conversation with the tool to refine one or more linked scripts.

Towards this goal, the project will combine data from themes as diverse as transportation, social distancing measures, demographic and environmental factors, as well as economic impacts. Knowledge graphs are contextualization technologies. They enable their users to gain a more holistic understanding of complex social and scientific questions by providing actionable insights from neighboring disciplines. For instance, making decisions about local economies and food systems require an understanding of the frequently changing social distancing measures, traffic control and restrictions including  neighboring regions,  demographic factors, and the percentage of recovered citizens. The project will work together with industry partners to understand how graphed knowledge can be utilized in their forecasting models. Finally, the project will reach out to other knowledge graphs to jointly form an open knowledge network related to COVID-19.<br/><br/>    More technically, we will utilize a stack of open source technologies and international standards to develop a highly integrated Linked Data-based knowledge graph that combines cross-domain data across different geographic scales and types of places.  We will utilize machine learning technologies to learn graph embeddings for predicting links within our graph as well as alignments to other graphs by using places such as cities or counties as points of integration. We will also provide the functionality to collaborate with the broader schema.org effort. We are particularly interested in studying how to represent and align COVID-19 data that is currently being reported at different geographic scales and aggregates, thereby fostering interoperability and breaking up data silos. We will work directly with our industry partners on engineering (spatially-explicit) features from our and external graphs. These features will be integrated into industry downstream forecasting models with a particular focus on food systems. Finally, We will utilize the expertise of our partners in creating visual data dashboards to better communicate our findings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, if the US Treasury had access to private financial information from all domestic and foreign banks, financial markets, and even social networks, they might have been able to foresee the Great Recession of 2008. This project uses the same principle but is focused on computational tools and biomedical information with the potential to advance discovery across a range of biomedical disciplines.   <br/><br/>Specifically, this Convergence Accelerator Phase I project will create a biomedical knowledge engine by integrating information from multiple biomedical databases. With the use of artificial intelligence, it will empower researchers with the tools to accelerate basic biomedical research as well as drug discover, and doctors with potentially unprecedented patient insights. The broader impact and potential societal benefit of this program lies on its ability to facilitate and democratize access to highly-specialized, yet publicly available information of biomedical importance. Currently, the majority of biomedical data sources are secluded within dedicated portals with minimal, if any, integration. This convergent project integrates wide-ranging expertise, from genomics, pharmacology and patient care, to computer science, deep data science, and epistemology. This team comprises research groups from academic institutions (University of California San Francisco), government (Lawrence Livermore National Labs), non-profit (Institute for Systems Biology) and commercial entities (Google), and during the project will engage with other organizations. While these groups have been collaborating (mostly in a pair-wise fashion) in projects with a smaller scope, this project intends to crystallize the team around a larger, common objective. The deliverables specified in this Phase I effort will contribute to the creation of a knowledge network (graph) composed of billions of concepts connected by biologically meaningful relationships. The graph will be open to the general public, accessible via manual or automated searches, whose content can be updated or modified, much like the world wide web is today. <br/><br/>Integrating vast amounts of information from multiple domains to an extensive knowledge network opens for the first time the possibility to computationally navigate the graph across disciplines that normally do not interact (like internal medicine and molecular biology). Furthermore, because the knowledge graph that will be developed contains domain-specific knowledge but not individual patient data, it does not pose privacy concerns. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the significant integration of domain expertise across team members and the leveraging of data resources that have been created by other publicly and privately funded efforts. The project lays the groundwork for a resource that will potentially afford researchers and practitioners immediate access to the totality of all relevant ""biomedical facts"" - in the style of Google search, with the potential to change biomedical research, drug development and even the way medicine is practiced across the nation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
