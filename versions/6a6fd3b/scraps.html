<p>The Knowledge Graph Of Everything is a colonial surveillance project</p>

<p>Who is the universal knowledge graph for?</p>

<p>Surveillance capitalism dreams of a universal knowledge graph: In defense of vulgar infrastructures</p>

<p>An extension of “Linked Data or Surveillance Capitalism” in the infrastructure piece - arguing that infrastructure is not neutral and the kinds of knowledge graph infrastructure being built by the NSF and NIH is potentially harmful and not likely to resolve fundamental infrastructural deficits</p>

<p>What does the cloud want? The cloud dreams of lakes and a network of everything. imagining the futures of data infrastructure.</p>

<p>Surveillance capitalism is the dominant economic model, and so when a federal government intends to direct its research organizations to build new data infrastructures, we should take note. This piece is about how the cloud, as an assemblage of property relations and systematic logics structures and sets the horizon of what we can imagine our data infrastructure to be. Its vision of the future for our data is a graph of everything, where they host and graciously provide access to a universalized surveillance apparatus. Their future has autonomous reasoning agents sifting through endless lakes of data in order to provide us with the miraculous insight that holds us back from a seemingly immediately-realizable future where all poverty and climate change is solved. If only we have the right <em>insights.</em> Where we get data lakes to sift through with AI chatbot-like interfaces, they get to restructure and provide platforms/dashboards on the graph of everything as an infinity of new profit extraction mechanisms. It won’t work for any of the lofty goals we intend for it, but it doesn’t have to in order to fulfill its role as a profit-generating platform (see cognitive expectations of search)</p>

<p>Who owns the graph? Who <em>really</em> owns the graph?</p>

<p>In defense of vulgar linked data, where we dispense with the notion of a unified graph of everything as a colonial project, and instead re-imagine the future of our data as vernacular, local, oriented around the power of expression rather than the power of consumption. Data in their view is as a natural resource to be mined, extracted, and made sense of - it is “something out there” to be captured and harnessed. To be brought in line with the universal order of things.</p>

  <p>With a large-scale knowledge graph, developers can build high-dimensional representations of entities and relations. The resulting embeddings will greatly benefit many machine-learning, NLP, and AI tasks as sources of features and constraints, and can form the basis for more sophisticated inferences and ways to curate training data.

<blockquote>
  <p>Big Dick Data is a formal, academic term that we, the authors, have coined to denote big data projects that are characterized by masculinist, totalizing fantasies of world domination as enacted through data capture and analysis. Big Dick Data projects ignore context, fetishize size, and inflate their technical and scientific capabilities.4 In GDELT’s case, the question is whether we should take its claims of big data at face value or whether the Big Dick Data is trying to trick funding organizations into giving the project massive amounts of research funding. (We have seen this trick work many times before.) [<a class="citation" href="#dignazioDataFeminism2020">247</a>]</p>

          <li>Think broader than search engines though, the pernicious and dangerous part here is that we could merge several classes of platform and surveillance harm: individual surveillance could merge with medical and public information and insurance information and the rest in an interoperable interchange format so that the data brokering economy woudl effectively explode. Imagine the splintering of infinitely many platforms that each owned some subset of the data, each platform holder owning all of them and slicing them off to you and pocketing the costs.</li>
          <li>merged with research and reference data, they could literally make a graph of all information and supplant libraries, etc. for all information from news to government to personal.</li>
