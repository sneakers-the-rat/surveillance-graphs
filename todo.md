# Copy Editing

- Capitalization
	- Biolink

# Clarification

- End the end, more examples of what each of these different ideologies looks like.
	- Isntead of a bunch of services, a data model that we control with a bunch of different views on it
- Have to clarify that we want to do some of the same things, like being able to link biomedical and other data, but rather than being a universalizing project intended to be mined by some unknown third party, it's a direct social process where the relevant researchers have tools that directly support their work and negotiating schemas and sharing between one another. 
	- Rather than "mining" information, directly support its creation. Since the ideology of convenience also pervades scientific publishing - just throw a word doc at the wall, rather than having fluid tooling that supports a more dialogical work process.
- Add the "whole show" data + algorithm + etc. citations to the NSF section as an example of algorithmic bias in administration of benefits. 

# General

- Integrate Palantir examples in biomedical surveillance section
- Cite in "categorization is a power relationship" {% cite poirierClassificationCatachresisDouble2019 %}
- Freebase was a folksonomy that used types like tags!!!! See entity oriented search p 46. how did i forget to write about this lmao
	- make sure to refer to the sections on search in entity based search when writing the "ai and kgs" section
- Go back through Andrew's comments on the Translator section and update what needs to be updated!

# Criticism

- Why do we need to conceptualize the act of categorization as one privileged group categorizing another, or categorizing everything "for" everyone else? Could we instead recast the process as one where everyone is able to make the categorizations of their world visible (to the degree that's desirable) so that they can be given their full reality as coequal to all other systems of representation?


# Web 

- Just use this for toc? http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js
