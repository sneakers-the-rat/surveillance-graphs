Criticism
- Why do we need to conceptualize the act of categorization as one privileged group categorizing another, or categorizing everything "for" everyone else? Could we instead recast the process as one where everyone is able to make the categorizations of their world visible (to the degree that's desirable) so that they can be given their full reality as coequal to all other systems of representation?
