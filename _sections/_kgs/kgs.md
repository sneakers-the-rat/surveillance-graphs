What are Knowledge Graphs, and why do they deserve particular attention in an always-more-fraught landscape of digital technology? 

- Definition of knowledge graphs
- Use in industry
	- Differentiation from prior models of cloud computing and storage
	- Why in particular were they adopted by google et al?
	- Google's KG in particular:
		- {% cite juelvangEthicsGoogleKnowledge2013 %} - since its creation, people have been questioning the role of google as arbiter or all knowledge. In fact this really freaking pissed off wikipedia and is sort of indicative of the general pillaging of the commons that this kind of business model represent
	- Other companies KGs {% cite noyIndustryscaleKnowledgeGraphs2019 %}
		- Microsoft:
			- Bing
			- Academic Graph
			- LinkedIn Graph
		- Facebook: {% cite weaverFacebookLinkedData2013 %}
	- Natural counterpart to sprawling surveillance
		- This is exactly why they will be so powerful for our kind of generalized digital infrastructure we want to build: the corporate platforms have identified a tool that can be used to run the world's information. 
		- Eg relx. lots of information acquired over time from a lot of different locations, needs to be able to be reduced to some unified system, and graphs work at the level of propositions and assertions that can then be traversed and resolved. 
		- You also end up having a lot of multidomain data that could refer to the same entity, but in ways that were unanticipated by the initial schema for the object
		- unlike traditional relational databases, this is no problem for a graph. 
		- This also can work in a common interface: you get really dramatically different kinds of information for different kinds of objects, including different kinds of actions that can be taken, but those can be represented in a common format on a graph. 
		- Inference: you can then make logical inferences based on the networked information, this is a natural thing to want to do for search engines, as you are able to "fill in" information that isn't explicitly encoded in the database. Inference also is coproductive with the evolution into chatbots - if you provide some information about some flight you want to take, then the graph can know what information hasn't beeen provided in a complex concept. 
	- The evolution into chatbots
		- These companies want to be able to provide some interface to this graph without revealing it, chatbots are effectively a way to launder knowledge graphs into some information-consumer facing interface that lets them traverse the graph with natural language. Eg. you can hold the context of the graph in mind when doing subsequent searches
		- They want to make the processes of curating their graphs more interactive! A new kind of information serfdom - presumably google wants you to tell it when its information box is incorrect!?
		- Relationship between graphs and surveillance technologies: {% cite iliadisSeerSeenSurveying2022 %}
	- And the broader universe of surveillance
		- Policing: {% cite brayneBigDataSurveillance2017 braynePredictSurveilData2020 %}
		- NSF graph describes military applications by the boatload
- The fundamental contradiction of platform capitalism
- Open source data, proprietary compute.
	- eg. wikidata, github copilot, pattern of corporations exploiting open source 
	- The transition of freebase as an autonomous knowledge graph to one owned by google, shut down, and then a lot of that labor transitioned to wikidata: {% cite pellissiertanonFreebaseWikidataGreat2016 chahOKGoogleWhat2018 %}

	> While Palantir may claim otherwise, we believe there is enough evidence in these patents to suggest that Palantir has an internal knowledge base or knowledge graph for labeling entities in the world, along with their attributes and relationships, and that these occluded resources are not fully released to users, but that users are subject to them in using the products. {% cite iliadisSeerSeenSurveying2022 %}
