Through their cloud of corporate jargon, knowledge graphs are relatively straightforward to define {% cite chaudhriKnowledgeGraphsIntroduction2022 hitzlerReviewSemanticWeb2021 yanRetrospectiveKnowledgeGraphs2018 %} (though see {% cite ehrlingerDefinitionKnowledgeGraphs2016 %}): **directed, labeled graphs** consisting of *nodes* corresponding to entities like a person, dataset, location, etc. and *edges* that describe their relationship[^triplets]. Knowledge graphs typically make use of some controlled **ontology** that provide a specific set of terms and how they are to be used, and "types" that give a given entity an expected set of *properties* denoted by edges with a particular set of labels from the ontology. For example, the schema.org [Person](https://schema.org/Person) type would be applied to a node, and then have a set of labeled edges like `gender` or `email` that link to other nodes that contain the values of the properties. 

Why does such a seemingly ordinary data structure deserve particular attention in an always-more-fraught landscape of digital technology? The story of knowledge graphs is the story of the enclosure of the wild and open web into a series of surveillance-backed platforms. They provide an underexplored lens onto the present and future of digital infrastructure as planned by information conglomerates --- and serve as a liberatory kernel that hints at how we might chart a different course.
