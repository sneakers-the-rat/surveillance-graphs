Knowledge graphs as a technology are relatively straightforward to define {% cite chaudhriKnowledgeGraphsIntroduction2022 hitzlerReviewSemanticWeb2021 yanRetrospectiveKnowledgeGraphs2018 bergmanCommonSenseView2019 %} (though see {% cite ehrlingerDefinitionKnowledgeGraphs2016 %}): **directed, labeled graphs** consisting of *nodes* corresponding to entities like a person, dataset, location, etc. and *edges* that describe their relationship[^triplets]. Knowledge graphs typically make use of some controlled **ontology** that provides a specific set of terms for nodes and edges and how they are to be used, and "types" that give a given entity an expected set of *properties* represented by edges. This makes for an extremely general data structure, where heterogeneous data can form a continuous graph in a way that is both structured and can accomodate ad-hoc modification not anticipated by a schema. For example, in wikidata, Peter Kropotkin ([Q5752](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5752)) is an [instance of](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31) the "[human](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5)" type, which [has properties](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1963) like [`sex or gender`](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P21) ([male](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6581097)) and [`place of birth`](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P19) ([Moscow](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q649)), but also has additional properties not in the `human` type like [`signature`](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P109). Each of the "edges" like `place of birth` link to other nodes like `Moscow`, which in turn have their own sets of links, and so on.

Knowledge graphs are in themselves a fairly ordinary class of data structures and technologies, but their history is the story of the enclosure of the wild and open web into a series of surveillance-backed platforms.
