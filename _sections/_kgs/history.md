	- Explicit algo + KG model - entity oriented search: {% cite balogEntityOrientedSearch2018 %} 
	- KGs are best for heterogeneous data: {% cite ceravoloBigDataSemantics2018 %} and specifically in the business case: {% cite chaudhriKnowledgeGraphsIntroduction2022 %}

Linked Open Data Vs. Knowledge Graphs - KGs are products! LOD is a messy and wily ball of data!

The problem of belief: what should these things do? present us instantly with results? or should they be part of a messy dialectic of information where the graph itself is the outcome? The cloud orthodoxy suggests the former!

- Need to articulate the components of the cloud orthodoxy mindset
	- Automated reasoning
	- More data is better
	- Neutral reflection of underlying facts, only conditioning factor is 'confidence', but no criticism of schema
	- End goal is productized services: eg. the fantasy of the google researcher in 2018 at the end of entity oriented search
	- Convenience
	- Performance
	- Assumes that we are all subjects of surveillance, that the data is "out there" to be mined, and its heterogeneity is an inconvenience or technical problem.

### Claims

- KGs are the dominant mode of integrating heterogeneous data: {% cite sequedaDesigningBuildingEnterprise2021 azziniAdvancesDataManagement2021 allemangMergingDataGraphs2022 %}
- KGs + AI are gonna try and do "explainable AI" - {% cite janowiczNeuralsymbolicIntegrationSemantic2020 renLegoLatentExecutionguided2021 %}
	- Microsoft: KGs necessary for chatbots - "the LLMs don't *know anything* {% cite huEmpoweringLanguageModels2022 %}. Google: {% cite renLegoLatentExecutionguided2021 %}
	- AI is the future of KGs - {% cite chaudhriKnowledgeGraphsIntroduction2022 %}
> "Second, there is a clear recognition that KG representations are a central ingredient to achieving the compositional behavior in AI systems."
- They want to integrate these with your personal knowledge graph: Google alredy owns all your calendar/etc. data, now they want you to take notes in a way that can be more easily mined: {% cite balogPersonalKnowledgeGraphs2019a %}. Under the guise of convenience - "update my location across all my apps"
