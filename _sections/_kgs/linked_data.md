Much of the work of the semantic web project in the early 2000s focused on the "global" side of this tension at the expense of the "local" - creating ontologies and related technologies intended to serve as a foundation for expressing basic things in a common vocabulary {% cite hitzlerReviewSemanticWeb2021 %}. This work had many successes, but began a schism between the priesthood of people concerned with making systems that were *correct* and those that were more concerned with making things that *worked* - or supported "local" expression (eg {% cite {% cite palmerDitchingSemanticWeb2008 %}). Aaron Swartz captured this frustration in his unfinished book:

> Instead of the “let’s just build something that works” attitude that made the Web (and the Internet) such a roaring success, they brought the formalizing mindset of mathematicians and the institutional structures of academics and defense contractors. They formed committees to form working groups to write drafts of ontologies that carefully listed (in 100-page Word documents) all possible things in the universe and the various properties they could have, and they spent hours in Talmudic debates over whether a washing machine was a kitchen appliance or a household cleaning device. {% cite swartzAaronSwartzProgrammable2013 %}

Lindsay Poirier describes this difference in "thought styles" as a rift between the "neats" focused on universalizing *a priori* ontologies and the "scruffies" focused on everyday use and letting the structure appear afterwards {% cite poirierTurnScruffyEthnographic2017 %}. The latter characterizes the "second age" of the Semantic Web after 2006 - the reorganization around **Linked Data** {% cite berners-leeLinkedData2006 hitzlerReviewSemanticWeb2021 %}. The era of Linked Data de-emphasized the idealistic and ideological goals of the early Semantic Web, driven more by an empirical approach of trying to realize these systems on the wilds of the web, creating some of the first public "Linked Open Data" systems like DBPedia and Freebase.

This turn coincides with the emerging platformatization and enclosure of the web as "Web 2.0." Throughout the early 2000s, the work of the Semantic Web project was largely invisible to the ordinary web user, and its vision of a self-organizing web was easily outcompeted by the now-ubiquitous use of search engines to index the web. Where in the early 2000s web architects were imagining the future of web continuing to take place on free and open *protocols,* the Linked Data/Web 2.0 era corraled us into a pattern of *platforms* which quickly ratcheted their way to dominance in a positive feedback loop of user experience design, network effects and profit. On platforms, rather than a system that "belongs" to everyone, you are granted access to some specific set of operations through an interface so that you can be part of a social process of producing and curating information for the platform holder.
