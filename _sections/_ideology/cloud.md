## The Cloud Orthodoxy

Ideology evades any singular definition, and I'm not obnoxious enough to claim I had a Complete and True Perspective[^nonuniversal] on something as multifarious as the belief system underlying The Cloud as an infrastructural pattern. To set the Terms and Conditions of this section: this definition is a necessary strawman to make sense of patterns of outcomes and pose as contrast to our alternative. I describe the Cloud Orthodoxy as a belief *system* because none of its components are unique or necessary for any one person to believe, but they are mostly mutually reinforcing and self-compatible. Many of these beliefs are not "bad" in themselves - assuming that the adherents of an ideology don't believe they are "bad" people is a foundational part of trying to understand them. These ideas of course draw on a mountain of prior thought[^priorthought], and I admit my relative inexperience and will certainly need to completely rewrite them in future work.

The Terms and Conditions having been settled, in no particular order:

A cardinal value of Cloud Orthodoxy is **convenience.** The internet should be *fast,* *reliable,* and everything[^IP] should be available on demand. Convenience is elevated at the exclusion of other values when in conflict like shared power or flexibility. **Complexity is a cognitive nuisance** for people with otherwise busy full lives, so it should be hidden as much as possible. **Interface design** is a major point of competition between platforms because it is a primary point of comparison when consuming a platform --- again, to the exclusion of others.

The world is **asymmetrical and hierarchical.** I am a consumer, a *user* and I trade my power to a *developer* or platform owner in exchange for convenience. The purpose of the internet is for platform holders to **provide services** to users. As a user I have a right to *speak with the manager,* but do not have a right to decide which services are provided or how. As a platform owner I have a right to demand whatever the users will give me in exchange for my services. **Powerlessness is a feature:** platform owners can freely experiment on users to optimize their experience without their knowledge. Information is asymmetrical in multiple ways: platforms collect and hold more information than the users can have and parcel it back out as services. But also, platform holders are the only ones *capable* of creating their services, and so they are responsible for the convenience prescribed for a platform but not the convenience of users understanding how to make the platform themselves.

**The Platform has agency.** Computational "agents" are dispatched by the platform, not by you. The Platform provides a fixed set of features with a fixed set of affordances. The platform creates possibilities for the users. The **Platform harnesses people** and gives them the means to crowdsource information --- without the Platform they are just stray sheep. **Users are unreliable** --- they lie, cheat, and subvert the game established by the Platform, so **only the Platform can ensure safety and reliability.** **Users are fundamentally interchangeable** and isolated from one another: they should not be expected to know anything or have anything aside from money, the platform should provide everything for them. **Users make content** for the Platform, which increases its value for other users. 

**Information is a commodity. Information is Data.** Information is a natural resource to be mined. Information is **true or false** regardless of context or positionality. **Ambiguity is a bug** - there is a single True way of describing the world[^googleranking]. Data that does not conform to the correct schema is *unclean.* The highest goal of all data is to be **machine readable.** Provenance is a matter of estimating degree of certainty about Truth, not situating information in its context. **More data is better[^bigdickdata].** Uncertainty is a deviation from some underlying, natural, true value, and can be fixed by having more or higher *quality* data. Where users make content, **the Platform reveals insights** from a large enough dataset by applying the right algorithmic computation or reasoning agent --- the platform refines data into Knowledge[^spokeknowledge]. **The Platform knows better** than individual, atomized users because it has more data than them, and so the Platform should collect as much of their data as possible to provide them the best service. It is impossible or inconvenient for users to make use of all the world's data, so the role of the Platform is to provide Knowledge as a service by algorithmically sorting feeds, providing summaries, and so on. **Privacy is at the discretion of the Platform,** since data is needed to make derivative services that ultimately benefit the user. If the user doesn't like this arrangement, they are free to not use the Platform. The benefit of the platform doesn't necessarily need to be for the particular user who is providing data or content --- **The Platform matches different kinds of users** like advertisers to customers, law enforcement agencies to suspects, etc. in order to maximize the overall value of all Platforms.

One could summarize the Cloud Orthodoxy as a rough kind of unexamined enlightenment-era positivism 

That positive caricature of the Cloud Orthodoxy of course omits the brutality of the capitalistic system it is embedded within and reproduces the logic of. 

**close with describing the outcomes: so given these beliefs, one creates a technology which validates the beliefs. given the backdrop of capitalsim it takes an extractive form, and so on and so forth**
