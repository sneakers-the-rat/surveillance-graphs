## The Cloud Orthodoxy

Ideology evades any singular definition, and I'm not obnoxious enough to claim I had a Complete and True Perspective[^nonuniversal] on something as multifarious as the belief system underlying The Cloud as an infrastructural pattern. To set the Terms and Conditions of this section: this definition is a necessary strawman to make sense of patterns of outcomes and pose as contrast to our alternative. I describe the Cloud Orthodoxy as a belief *system* because none of its components are unique or necessary for any one person to believe, but they are mostly mutually reinforcing and self-compatible. Many of these beliefs are not "bad" in themselves - assuming that the adherents of an ideology don't believe they are "bad" people is a foundational part of trying to understand them. These ideas of course draw on a mountain of prior thought, and I admit my relative inexperience and will certainly need to completely rewrite them in future work.

The Terms and Conditions having been settled, in no particular order:

A cardinal value of Cloud Orthodoxy is **convenience.** The internet should be *fast,* *reliable,* and everything[^IP] should be available on demand. Convenience is elevated at the exclusion of other values when in conflict like shared power or flexibility. **Complexity is a cognitive nuisance** for people with otherwise busy full lives, so it should be hidden as much as possible. **Interface design** is a major point of competition between platforms because it is a primary point of comparison when consuming a platform --- again, to the exclusion of others.

The world is **asymmetrical and hierarchical.** I trade my power in exchange for convenience. The purpose of the internet is for platform holders to **provide services** to consumers. As a consumer I have a right to be able to *speak with the manager* and have my problems fixed, but do not have a right to decide which services are provided or how. As a platform holder I have a right to demand whatever the consumers will give me in exchange for my services. Information is asymmetrical in multiple ways: platforms collect and hold more information than the consumers can have and parcel it back out as services. But also, platform holders are the only ones *capable* of creating their services, and so they are responsible for the convenience prescribed for a platform but not the convenience consumers understanding how to make the platform themselves.

**The Platform has agency.** Computational "agents" are dispatched by the platform, not by you. The Platform provides a fixed set of features with a fixed set of affordances. The platform creates possibilities for the users. The **Platform harnesses people** with a goal and a set of dials and knobs to crowdsource information. 

**Information is a commodity.** 

- major themes
	- convenience
		- fast, reliable, etc.
	- asymmetric
		- but patronizing: this naturally divides into producers and consumers
		- information asymmetries: we have more data than you, but also we know what we're doing and you don't -> we have to own it so that we can provide services for you
	- agency
		- tools v platforms
		- crowdsourcing, people should be given a very constrained means of expression
		- moderation 
	- the nature of information
		- singularity of definition
		- we know what's better for you than you do
		- people are fundamentally interchangeable, isolated. not necessarily uniform, but the axes along which they vary can be measured and estimated. We are not necessarily serving a particular community and we definitely aren't a part of it - we serve the arbitrary consumer.
		- people make content
		- privacy is a lower concern than all others because you basically owe us that information anyway and we can more stuff with it than you.

- Need to articulate the components of the cloud orthodoxy mindset
	- Automated reasoning
	- More data is better
	- 'data' as a projection of 'information' is a commodity, inert, factual, external.
	- Neutral reflection of underlying facts, only conditioning factor is 'confidence', but no criticism of schema
	- End goal is productized services: eg. the fantasy of the google researcher in 2018 at the end of entity oriented search
	- Convenience
	- Performance
	- Assumes that we are all subjects of surveillance, that the data is "out there" to be mined, and its heterogeneity is an inconvenience or technical problem.
	- There is "one" of something - there is one index that refers to the concept of a man, or a given person, etc. rather than many contextual representations of that thing.
		- the poltics of ontologies are neatly illustrated by the fact that "a woman is a woman" means precisely the opposite thing w.r.t trans woman to transmisics as compared to normal people.
	- It doesn't have to work! as long as it seems like it does
	- Rather than building tools for people that they might use to actually integrate the system in their work or lives, but instead some means of scraping it afterwards (eg. SCALES), so who is this actually for? the people studying people doing work, or for the people doing the work? When things are intended for the people actually doing the work, they are invariably platforms that provide just enough functionality to keep people using them while surveilling them as the main purpose.
	- we are interchangeable consumers, we are not expected to "have anything" or "come with anything" - we are customers of some web service. The notion of **agency** is never afforded to people: **agents** are computational, and specifically on a computer than you don't own. You can tell a web agent to do something for you, but you yourself do not have agentic behavior on ther web.
	- the expectation that we shouldn't have to organize something, that we should be able to buy it.
	- that we should be able to complain to the manager, because we are the customer
	- in some ways most of this is pinned in place by the ideology of capitalism, if youh ave a backdrop of some companies needing to take some action, they abstract away the social relationship of labor into a product for you, which you can then rent. 
	- trust via gatekeeping: you can trust us because we limit the power within the system carefully, as opposed to eg. soft security
		- trust in a corporate context is having someone to sue, but the same conditions of trust don't need to apply in all contexts.
		- that platforms are necessary to moderate and police what is allowed. that freedom is *unsafe* so they have our best interests in mind.
	- consent is at the discretion of the platform holder
	- "truer" information emerges with *more* information - you can derive infinite chains of insight from more and more data. Since information is 'true' or 'false' or else has a strict set of conditions, it is possible to "know everything" and everyone "knowing everything" is the goal.

not a complete definition, but describing some basic traits. not all traits are always true, but they fit together into a means of understanding digital infrastructures - a means of establishing values

Why on *earth* would we want our insurance provider to be able to adjust their premiums based on our private medical information, even if it is "de-identified"

The problem of belief: what should these things do? present us instantly with results? or should they be part of a messy dialectic of information where the graph itself is the outcome? The cloud orthodoxy suggests the former!


- The argument that the next phase of everything is chatbots and 


The merger of AI shit and knowledge graph shit

So if web 2.0 was about the platformatization of the web, what is up next? In the same way that information conglomerates successfully harnessed open source for profit, now can we effectively gamify the entirety of knowledge generation process? can we put ppl inside of information curation chambers when they search?

"Explainable AI" is gonna come from knowledge graphs yo

Broad principles
- Strategic use of "openness" when it facilitates greater market control and to prevent someone else from capturing a particular element of the technology.	
	- Same thing as with the DOI: the linking agreements were killing us! Get some barrier to commerce out of the way (ontology discontinuity) so that the commerce can intensify, not so that it can abate

> Peter Mika: A natural next step for Knowledge Graphs is to extend beyond the boundaries of organisations, connecting data assets of companies along business value chains. This process is still at an early stage, and there is a need for trade associations or industry-specific standards organisations to step in, especially when it comes to developing shared entity identifier schemes. {% cite panExploitingLinkedData2017 %}

**close with describing the outcomes: so given these beliefs, one creates a technology which validates the beliefs. given the backdrop of capitalsim it takes an extractive form, and so on and so forth**
