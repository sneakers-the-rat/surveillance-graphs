## Vulgar Linked Data

> "The popular vernaculars are vast speech-jungles, in which old forms are decaying and new ones continually springing into life; and this fermentation results in the creation of numberless new terms, which come to birth and live and die in tropical profusion. They are formed in living response to the needs of the moment; the greater number of them hardly survive the occasion that brought them forth; but others, on account of their expressive power and their usefulness, establish themselves, spread from district to district.

> For human speech is after all a democratic product, the creation, not of scholars and grammarians, but of unschooled and unlettered people. Scholars and men of education may cultivate and enrich it, and make it flower into all the beauty of a literary language; but its rarest blooms are grafted on a wild stock, and its roots are deep-buries in the common soil. From that soil it must still draw its sap and nourishment, if it is not to perish, as the other standard languages of the past have perished, when, in the course of their history, they have been separated and cut off from the popular vernacular --- from that vulgar speech which has ultimately replaced their outworn and archaic forms."

Is it still possible to imagine a different world than the one the information conglomerates have planned for us? Can we imagine a properly *human* information infrastructure?

We can start by identifying the harms of the world as it exists to understand why a new world is needed, as I have attempted some small part of in this piece. Harm, in this case, is not some speculative future of superintelligent sentient AI, but elaboration of ongoing harms of the surveillance and platform economies. 

Building a better informational world is not a matter of choosing a different set of technologies --- I argue that in this case some of the masters tools can help us rebuild his house. At the same time we can't overcorrect in our focus on social problems and dismiss technology as a strategy, a tool, and a manifestation of values, belief, and labor. We must have an answer to the well meaning liberal that mistakes the dynamics of surveillance capitalism or their role in it: that understands that these knowledge graphs are not truly universal, that the LLMs are not sentient, but embraces their logic because they're so *useful.* We have to understand why simply building open source LLMs or nonprofit linked data platforms is not a liberatory strategy. We have to appreciate how the unmet needs of information organization are caused by the very systems that claim to meet them.

At the same time, we can't dismiss those needs. How could we possibly tell someone with vision impairments not to use "AI" tools for summarizing images, or someone with motor or speech impairments not to use LLMs as a communication aid? It is true that making better use of biomedical data could lead to better treatments. Indecipherable government bureaucracy due to ancient data infrastructure is an informational injustice. So simple abstinence or resistance to universalizing knowledge graphs and LLMs is also not an effective strategy, especially if our alternative is an embrace of the same cloud platform systems whose logic spawned them. 

The constant partial satisfaction and construction of new needs, *the hollow middle* at the center of every cloud platform, is a powerful opening. The structure of contemporary platforms always pose a fundamental lack:[^platformstudies] as a service, some functionality must always be withheld to create a walled garden or nurture dependence. Even platforms without an intended profit motive have their own "platform logic" --- constraining their use to only exactly what the developers intended it to be used for. For a project intended to organize information, why is it difficult for me to find the different components of the Translator project? Since its creators imagined "users" interacting only with the frontends of its platforms, little emphasis was placed on the discoverability of the whole system, and, critically, there is no way for me to contribute something like that and have it be visible by . This is true of all the ways large and small that platforms are mismatched with our expectations and needs --- even though we subscribe to 15 or 20 different platforms, why is it that we always need to find yet another to do something even slightly outside the finite imagination of their developers?[^listicles]

Another set of openings come from the problems cloud platforms pose for themselves that are flatly ridiculous when described plainly. *Why on earth* do I have to route my file through some cloud datacenter thousands of miles away to send it several inches between my phone and computer? *Why on earth* should I need a near-flawless, high-bandwidth internet connection to *edit a plain text document?* *Why on earth* do I have to rely on an effectively unregulated and hostile intermediary like Facebook or Twitter to communicate with my family and friends, or even to *merely exist online?* *Why on earth* is my *car* spying on me so some company I have never heard of can sell my data to an insurance provider? *Why on earth* is it possible for a hospital system to volunteer my personal medical information without IRB approval {% cite nelsonIntegratingBiomedicalResearch2019 %}? Why is the best we can do to frame that question as a matter of consent, *why is it possible for a platform to create and store and manipulate my personal information at all? {% cite hongControlCreepWhen2021 %}* You only have to engineer the kinds of systems capable of automatically[^humanlabor] extracting all informtion on the web *if you imagine the only possible system as one that universally indexes all information as one of a few hegemonic platforms.*
Why do we have to settle for systems that purposely limit our expectations to what the platform can provide as a "best guess[^searchenginesnotinevitable]?" 

 How did we come to imagine ourselves as so powerless?

Clearly, we need a change in *belief* to effectively challenge the deeply entrenched cloud-surveillance-platform archipelago. We need to unlearn what we have been taught to want, what we believe information technologies should do, and how they are supposed to work. We need to rethink our role in information technology, to move beyond the learned helplessness of the platform consumer and the petty tyranny of the platform operator. We need to reorganize our expectations of agency, beyond the division of labor that gives the power of final say over informational systems in the hands of a cadre of experts that the rest of us just make the best of. We don't have time to argue about whether we *can* build a better world[^crimethinc], to list all the many ways we are hemmed in by infrastructure and incentives, or to wait for another powerful entity with decidedly divergent interests like a government to save us --- we need to believe we too can be powerful.

An attempt to define another "Correct" counter-belief system would be missing the point, but we can't ignore the importance of naming and articulating belief in opening the possibility for and aligning action[^crimethinc2]. Our old belief systems are getting musty. It has been an important rallying cry, but **"Openness" alone has failed as a liberatory strategy.** All we make and offer up to each other freely is stolen ten times over by those who have much grander visions of enclosure. Without a strategy to resist co-option, our openness puts tools in the hands of the powerful. This is also not a fight that can be won with technical or legal changes like [ethical source licenses](https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/), though they are a useful idea. Drawing from a historiography of prior digital cultural movements like the semantic web, piracy, and the loosely-defined "fediverse[^amongothers]," I[^notjustme] argue that **vulgarity** opens up the space of belief for rethinking data infrastructures and attempt a rough definition.

**We** are the principle value of vulgar linked data. We don't wait for permission to be free, nor are we waiting on anyone else to save us. Convenience is secondary to to **agency.** Social bonds are more valuable than uptime. Our systems might stutter or crash sometimes, but we know who runs it because they are one of us. When we have a need, we have the tools to address it ourselves. We **cultivate abundance** instead of scarcity, we **cooperate rather than compete.** 

We have no dreams of universality or world domination, nor do we aspire to always make sense. 

We **linger in complexity** and relish in it. We are smart, capable, and complicated. We are **pluralistic and multiple.** 

- translation

We have no need for allegiance to any single identity, group, or cause {% cite bookchinNoteAffinityGroups1969 %}, we are all of them at once without conflict.

We are neither isolated nor selfish. Our dream is not one of solipsism, glued to our feeder bar, being "fed" the pellets of our social reality. **We are radically responsible to one another,** 

We aspire to build many digital worlds for **ourselves,** and we **merge and split and share** them freely. 

- egalitarianism, we don't imagine an anonymous user. we don't need to collect user stories because if someone needs something they can already do it themselves or ask for help. We diffuse information and power, because information often *is* power.


We are mutually empowered without mutual dependence. We are **always free to walk away,** both taking and leaving everything[^enlargespace], even if we might be missed.  

- **We keep each other safe.** 
- soft security

The only magic we are aware of is **cooperation.** We aren't interested in the trojan horses offered by the wealthy and powerful, we celebrate the gifts of our collaborators. 
- We are ethical, but our idealism isn't abstract. We care about what works more than the cloud ideologues do, they only care about what can extract profit for a company, actually meeting needs is just strategic opening.

- we own the information, so there is no need for "openness" as a concept. We share the things we intend to share because we refuse to participate in systems that privatize the world to profit from our peers. 

- we don't *fight* the powerful, we make their power *obsolete.*

I have written [at length](https://jon-e.net/infrastructure) about what vulgar linked data might look like in practice, but that work is of course always ongoing. 

vulgar LD is when we own it, rather than merely annotate things to be owned by google. what is the point where the owner of the graph can just say... no?

The problem of belief: what should these things do? present us instantly with results? or should they be part of a messy dialectic of information where the graph itself is the outcome? The cloud orthodoxy suggests the former!
