## Vulgar Linked Data

- transition to next section
	- the hollow middle: these things don't even *work* anyway {% cite broussardArtificialUnintelligenceHow2018 %}
		- always limited to *only exactly what the developers could imagine you wanting to do* - why should we *have to* always have our digital reality defined by someone else's ideology


vulgar LD is when we own it, rather than merely annotate things to be owned by google. what is the point where the owner of the graph can just say... no?

Stuff we draw from:
- feminist standpoint epistem. (cite data feminism and relationality lit!) {% cite mcquillanResistingAIAntifascist2022 %}
> Instead of seeing AI as an outside apparatus that takes in data about the world and spits out useful representations, we can see it as immersed in the process of shaping what things, including us, actually become. {% cite mcquillanResistingAIAntifascist2022 %}

Scraps: 

**Critically: Openness has failed us as an alternative** - it has been deeply coopted already!

- Search engine web was not inevitable either: {% cite intronaShapingWebWhy2000 %}
- as we saw with search! surveillance (in extreme part lmao) is encouraged by convenience - to make robots be maximally responsive and accurate in their responses to us, they need to fill in some missing context somewhere. surveillance is just an extremely valuable signal there. 
- open source and openness is not the alternative! FOSS can't compete with the KG part and is just a reflection of the same kind of ideology that drives the rest of the harms anyway. we need to hink of not only different tools but a fundamentally different ethos than the cloud service model. 
	- also this is why open platforms also don't work

- the poltics of ontologies are neatly illustrated by the fact that "a woman is a woman" means precisely the opposite thing w.r.t trans woman to transmisics as compared to normal people.

Why on *earth* would we want our insurance provider to be able to adjust their premiums based on our private medical information, even if it is "de-identified"

The problem of belief: what should these things do? present us instantly with results? or should they be part of a messy dialectic of information where the graph itself is the outcome? The cloud orthodoxy suggests the former!

- YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS SCALE OF AUTOMATED EXTRACTION IF YOU PRESUPPOSE A UNIVERSE OF A FEW MASSIVE PLATFORMS OWNING EVERYTHING IN THE FIRST PLACE re: amazon product graph example in {% cite chaudhriKnowledgeGraphsIntroduction2022 %}

- cognitive expectations of search
	- 2002 RDF Core WG talking about whether we want things to work like google or not... {% cite sticklerReMonotonicityWas2002 %} - https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0276.html

*Why does it always feel like there is a hollow middle?* - eg. I can't even index across the different projects in the translator. I feel like I always need to subscribe to some additional platform or service, rather than making cumulative progress on a single thing. Always tossed around in an endless sea. This is a reflection of platforms necessarily generating the fundamental lack which they can exploit - typically informational organization. Why do our public information infrastructures which shoudln't be subject to the same profit-based constraints as cloud platforms, also feel this way? Because the cloud paradigm is specifically designed to favor a particular paradigm of computing.
