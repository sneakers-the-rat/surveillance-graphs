The Cloud is not a neutral, inevitable, or optimal form of the web --- it has been actively constructed to facilitate a particular set of power and property relationships that make up the web's dominant business model. It is supported by a system of *values* and *beliefs* that are consciously affirmed to various degrees in a positive feedback loop with the expertise and resource investment that make its enabling technologies more developed and obvious than alternatives, in turn fueling the truth of those beliefs, including that of the inevitability of the cloud model itself. 

The history of the web is an odd substance: always present and eternal, yet profoundly ephemeral and immediately forgotten. It becomes increasingly difficult to imagine obscure roads not taken in the deeper architecture of the internet[^loveyanerds] with every fork. Before the dominance of compute in the cloud, distributed computing projects like folding@home were more powerful than any supercomputer[^fahcovid] {% cite v.FileFoldingHome2012 %}. Before the dominance of cloud video streaming platforms, peer-to-peer systems accounted for a majority of global internet traffic: in the mid-2000's between 49% and 95%, depending on the survey {% cite vandersarBitTorrentOneThird2006 vandersarP2PTrafficBooming2007 %}. 

The Cloud paradigm is at once phenomenally successful and riddled with obviously undesirable qualities. Cloud services promise large volumes of hassle-free storage --- but also make our data take a round trip across the planet if we want to transfer it between computers in the same room. Cloud systems are impressive feats of engineering, capable of serving immense quantities of data from relay CDNs dotted around the globe --- but only need to do so because of the preposterous inefficiency of needing to re-serve data like streaming video in full each time they are accessed. Cloud systems can be made to have very high uptime, but then they do go down their dramatic centralization causes massive internet-wide blackouts even for systems that only depend on them indirectly {% cite lawlerAmazonServerOutage2021 hutchinsonAmazonWebServices2012 %}. Delivering cloud platforms through the browser requires less setup than local software, but the complexity of the underlying web standards make it [effectively impossible](https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html) {% cite devaultRecklessInfiniteScope2020 %} to escape the near-monopoly[^firefox] of Chrome[^chrome], and make many services completely unavailable if the internet goes out or even slows down.

That these tradeoffs are either not considered or seen as the natural constraints of internet technologies is precisely the evidence of The Cloud as ***ideology.*** By treating The Cloud as a system of *belief* we can better understand how its acolytes imagine the world they are creating --- and what they have in store to get us there. In particular, it is only possible to understand the *meaning* and *intention* of the surge of **chatbots** like chatGPT, Microsoft's integration into Bing, and Google's Bard as the logical conclusion of both the Cloud Orthodoxy and the history of Knowledge Graphs as a universal acid in data infrastructures. Finally, reopening the avenues foreclosed by its structuring beliefs, we will propose an alternative in **Vulgar Linked Data.**
