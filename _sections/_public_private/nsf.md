### NSF: Open Knowledge Network

While the NIH builds a set of universal knowledge graphs for biomedical information, the NSF is building them for everything else. Its Open Knowledge Network (OKN) project intends to "provide an essential public-data infrastructure for enabling an AI-driven future." {% cite baruOpenKnowledgeNetwork2022 %} OKN is in an earlier stage of development than the Translator, so this section is less focused on the details of individual projects and more to argue the pattern of public/private knowledge graphs is an emerging consensus.

Compared to the Translator, the OKN pulls punches for neither its utopian promises nor obvious risks. Some sections of its [roadmap](https://web.archive.org/web/20221028095757/https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2022-09/OKN%20Roadmap%20-%20Report_v03.pdf) are written in a style where each line shoots for the stars because even if some of them miss the result is a constellation of absolute bangers like "Harnessing the vast amounts of data generated in every sphere of life and transforming them into useful, actionable information and knowledge is crucial to the efficient functioning of a modern society[^whoomp]" {% cite baruOpenKnowledgeNetwork2022 %}. The project was initially proposed in 2017, went through two [cohorts](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/convergence-accelerator/portfolio) of projects within the [NSF Convergence Accelerator](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/convergence-accelerator/portfolio) in 2019 and 2020[^NSFconvergence], and [invited a broader submission](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22017/nsf22017.jsp) of proposals in November 2021 {% cite nationalsciencefoundationNSF22017Dear2021 %}. The roadmap comes at the end of a series of workshops in 2022 intended to scope and outline the OKN, so there is still very little public evidence of its progress to evaluate[^spoke].

Its domain is much broader than the Translator, and is unmistakeably bound up in both the United States Federal Government's military and political interests in Artificial Intelligence {% cite nationalsecuritycommissiononartificialintelligenceFinalReport2021 %} and the information economy's interests in making a universal space where all information can be bought and sold with minimal friction {% cite bigdatainteragencyworkinggroupOpenKnowledgeNetwork2018 %}. Where the Translator has the near-inevitable risk of being captured by information conglomerates, through the euphemism of "public private partnership" the OKN makes clear it was already captured at inception. 

Without mincing words, the OKN intends to make a Universal Knowledge Graph of Everything. They check all the boxes[^pattern]: a) make authoritative schemas for everything, b) link all possible data together, c) ingest data from as many sources as possible at whatever quality possible, d) integrate private with public data e) put it all in the cloud! (p. 18-19 "Creating an OKN" {% cite bigdatainteragencyworkinggroupOpenKnowledgeNetwork2018 %}). 

They OKN describes its work using a vocabulary of "vertical" "horizontal," where "vertical" applications refer to specific uses or domains like energy or health data, and "horizontal" themes like technologies and governance are shared across all domains. The "vertical" topics identified in the 2022 roadmap tell the story themselves:

- An **Integrated Justice Platform** group describes how greater surveillance across the entirety of the US justice system and every contact people have with it is necessary to decrease bias. The group outlines a wish list of data sources they would integrate - arrest and booking, jail, trial, prosecution, and the rest. A **Decarceration** group[^boozallen] describes extending that surveillance through to the rest of incarcerated people's lives after they are released - rehab, parole, foster care, shelters, public services use, etc. 

- both of these imagine the problem to be data rather than a structurally racist justice system: if we had more data then we would be able to help decarcerated people more. How about we don't incarcerate so many people and then when we release them we give them the actual resources they need to rebuild the life that was taken from them.

-C: Defense Innovation Programs

-D: NIEM - similar to BioLink but for government data.


They describe the "end-users and stakeholders" as everyone in the justice system except for incarcerated people or people that might otherwise be affected by a unified surveillance dragnet.

	- This, despite algorithmic policing and the foster care system being hella racist

- **More Efficient Capitalism**
	- Group A: Supply Chain Resiliency

- **Tracking People:** 

- **Climate Change** - actually could be good! but again teh real problem isn't data here, it's capitalism lmao
- homelessness group led by KFG, and actually doesn't seem to want to do things like hyper-surveil unhoused people, but the potential for repurposing is immense
- Collaborative Knowledge Network - like similar to what we're talking about here!
- the point is that through noble intentions, the basic structure of these things as gigantic data marketplaces inevitably tends towards maximizing surveillance data in order to sell control.
- and this is just the opening phase, to work on domain-specific projects before trying to do the actual work of targeted graph of everything building.



- Intends to be good!
	- Some ppl i like in here, knowledge futures group! a whole governance working group! 
	- Invokes wikipedia and wikidata without critical context of the role of openness in maintaining knowledge dominance.
- Examples:
	- KnowWhereGraph {% cite janowiczKnowKnowWhere2022 %}
- the critical thing here is that the US's two major public funding bodies have lined up to build unifying graphs of everything for ostensibly noble purposes but the information companies are literally licking their chops to eat this up. They have both effectively made new funding mechanisms that allow them to basically let private industry types what to build and how to build it, the academics get invited in to play for a bit, and then it's time to capture it later. The specifics aren't important, what's important is the pattern of layering public and private knowledge graphs that seem great and open on the surface but actually power some monstrously shittier technology underneath.
