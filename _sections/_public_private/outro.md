These two projects show the outlines of public information infrastructures to come. 

The two major public research funding agencies in the US have both devised novel funding mechanisms to be able to bypass typical review and include private industry in their data infrastructure projects {% cite nationalsciencefoundationNSFConvergenceAccelerator2019 consortiumBiomedicalDataTranslator2019 %}. These data infrastructures consist of a number of sub-projects for building new domain-specific and universalizing Semantic Web ontologies and cloud-based platforms for data storage and retrieval. Both are both explicitly oriented towards exposing structured data to "AI" and other derivative "big data" applications, rather than towards integrating in the daily work of researchers or the public at large. These and other[^EOSC] efforts like NIH's STRIDES initiative point towards a cloud-driven SaaS/PaaS future for public data infrastructure {% cite nationalinstitutesofhealthSTRIDESInitiative2021 %}.

The Translator and OKN and their subprojects have many possible fates: their grant funding could peter out and they could amount to very little beyond the scattered prototypes and spinoff startups that they've currently produced. They could flourish and become exactly what their creators intend them to be - the seamless data infrastructures of the future that manage to miracuously avoid all the potential for harm described above.

More important than the outcomes of these projects in particular is how the ruts of collective imagination drive both projects towards very similar designs with very similar flaws. They can only be understood against the backdrop of the history and present structure of the platformatized cloud-driven information economy writ large. Facing the limits of proprietary ontologies in private knowledge graphs, the information industry wants a set of cross-domain "top level" ontologies to enable the smooth interchange of public information that can then be integrated with "lower-level" private ontologies for an even greater array of surveillance-backed knowledge-as-a-service platforms. Under the guiding star of openness as an end in itself, researchers and funding agencies seem keen to provide it, and in partnership with private industry have adopted the logic of their platforms.

The lofty ambitions of universality alongside the intrinsic constraints of the cloud model are far from the only inevitable outcomes for public information infrastructure. Instead they are predicated on a very specific organization of ownership and power. Adopting the infrastructural pattern of the cloud strongly constrains the ambition of these infrastructures, as well as all but guarantees that whatever is produced by their period of active publicly-funded development will be swallowed up by information conglomerates hungry for control over the very valuable domains of medical and government data. Rather than challenging the dominance of the information rentiers by creating truly transformative public information infrastructure, these projects recapitulate their logic and deepen their dominance.

I am not painting a picture of active malice and conspiracy among bad actors to seize otherwise altruistic infrastructure. I am describing how uninterrogated prevailing values, beliefs, and existing infrastructures constrain what we can collectively imagine as possible --- the outcome of **ideology.**
