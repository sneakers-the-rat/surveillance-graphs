General principle of platformatization doing odd things with proprietariness - eg. the DOI was to facilitate extraction, not alleviate it. Information conglomerates exploit and EEE open source all the time. There is a basic dichotomy between "the code" or "the data" and the means by which it is possible to make use of it. In KGs specifically there is a certain amount of computation that is necessary within the networks, so even if the data is all public, the system can effectively be proprietary if it is impossible to use or one needs really sophisticated proprietary algorithms to make sense of it


Broad principles
- Strategic use of "openness" when it facilitates greater market control and to prevent someone else from capturing a particular element of the technology.	
	- Same thing as with the DOI: the linking agreements were killing us! Get some barrier to commerce out of the way (ontology discontinuity) so that the commerce can intensify, not so that it can abate

> Peter Mika: A natural next step for Knowledge Graphs is to extend beyond the boundaries of organisations, connecting data assets of companies along business value chains. This process is still at an early stage, and there is a need for trade associations or industry-specific standards organisations to step in, especially when it comes to developing shared entity identifier schemes. {% cite panExploitingLinkedData2017 %}

> With a large-scale knowledge graph, developers can build high-dimensional representations of entities and relations. The resulting embeddings will greatly benefit many machine-learning, NLP, and AI tasks as sources of features and constraints, and can form the basis for more sophisticated inferences and ways to curate training data. {% cite noyIndustryscaleKnowledgeGraphs2019 %}
