The emerging models


- the critical thing here is that the US's two major public funding bodies have lined up to build unifying graphs of everything for ostensibly noble purposes but the information companies are literally licking their chops to eat this up. They have both effectively made new funding mechanisms that allow them to basically let private industry types what to build and how to build it, the academics get invited in to play for a bit, and then it's time to capture it later. The specifics aren't important, what's important is the pattern of layering public and private knowledge graphs that seem great and open on the surface but actually power some monstrously shittier technology underneath.
- Census of outcomes at the end - it could be really bad, it could actually not amount to anything at all, but regardless this is illustrative of the way that the cloud constrains our thinking! Either nonfunctional or corporate! Note how much has been spent on each and give caveats like "ya these might not even amount to anything, but the point is the way that the existing cloud paradigm constrains the way that we think precisely in such a way that it is difficult to actually build the kind of effective infrastructure that we want. We have to acknowledge that the cloud model is not a universal computing paradigm, but one designed for a very specific mode of property relationships and profit models."

Scraps:

- I mean what could be different? how do we get out of the loop of trying to make "ok the real unified knowledge base for real this time guys" loop {% cite hoytUnifyingIdentificationBiomedical2022 %}. Maybe it's the belief that there should be a single unified naming system that's pathological? Maybe we need to focus on linking these things together rather than projecting them into some singular space.
- it is, in fact ideological! "SPOKE was conceived with the philosophy that if relevant information is connected, it can result in the emergence of knowledge, and hence provide insights into the understanding of diseases, discovering of drugs and proactively improving personal health." {% cite morrisScalablePrecisionMedicine2023 %}
- the hollow middle, right? like why is it so hard for me to even find all the ontologies that have been made by the biomedical translator project? why are most of the API endpoints in arax dead *already* - it hasn't even launched! why aren't there the tools for me to actually *use the information* in a way that wasn't specifically designed for in the platform? by focusng the design into these API-based data sources with platforms strapped on top of them, the project is limited to *only exactly what the developers could imagine and are capable of doing* rather than fulfullig the initial definition (find cite) of what "platforms" meant - an enabling technology that allows an expansive space of use that goes beyond the creators and enables and empowers people!
