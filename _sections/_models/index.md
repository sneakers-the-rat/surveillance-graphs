The emerging models

Scraps:

- I mean what could be different? how do we get out of the loop of trying to make "ok the real unified knowledge base for real this time guys" loop {% cite hoytUnifyingIdentificationBiomedical2022 %}. Maybe it's the belief that there should be a single unified naming system that's pathological? Maybe we need to focus on linking these things together rather than projecting them into some singular space.
- it is, in fact ideological! "SPOKE was conceived with the philosophy that if relevant information is connected, it can result in the emergence of knowledge, and hence provide insights into the understanding of diseases, discovering of drugs and proactively improving personal health." {% cite morrisScalablePrecisionMedicine2023 %}
