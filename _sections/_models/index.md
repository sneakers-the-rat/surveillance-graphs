The emerging models

Scraps:

- I mean what could be different? how do we get out of the loop of trying to make "ok the real unified knowledge base for real this time guys" loop {% cite hoytUnifyingIdentificationBiomedical2022 %}. Maybe it's the belief that there should be a single unified naming system that's pathological? Maybe we need to focus on linking these things together rather than projecting them into some singular space.
- it is, in fact ideological! "SPOKE was conceived with the philosophy that if relevant information is connected, it can result in the emergence of knowledge, and hence provide insights into the understanding of diseases, discovering of drugs and proactively improving personal health." {% cite morrisScalablePrecisionMedicine2023 %}
- the hollow middle, right? like why is it so hard for me to even find all the ontologies that have been made by the biomedical translator project? why are most of the API endpoints in arax dead *already* - it hasn't even launched! why aren't there the tools for me to actually *use the information* in a way that wasn't specifically designed for in the platform? by focusng the design into these API-based data sources with platforms strapped on top of them, the project is limited to *only exactly what the developers could imagine and are capable of doing* rather than fulfullig the initial definition (find cite) of what "platforms" meant - an enabling technology that allows an expansive space of use that goes beyond the creators and enables and empowers people!
