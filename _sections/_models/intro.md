move all discussion of what happens next into the 'kgs + ai' section that describes the failure of the public platforms, adoption into universal surveillance AI 

this section just introduce the notion that these projects and the appearance of some part of them as appearing inevitable is ideological. that nobody sets out with the intention of causing evil in the world - they see problems in the world, and thei beliefs about what the better circumstance might be and the possible ways by which we might realize it, all of that is structured by ideology. 

---



The recurring patterns in these projects trace the emerging consensus of public information projects. Expert councils will create unifying ontologies and launch platforms for public knowledge graph sources. These platforms will beget derivative platforms that mix that public data and private data along with some algorithmic computation to rent as a service. We are intended to populate and curate these public graph platforms with our public data as the crowd source. 

- projects doomed to fail
- even if not fail, eg. NIH agrees to just buck up and pay for the cloud service, they still reflect cloud ideology and place a hard limit on the ambitions for our infrastructures
- have to understand the appearance of this as the only form that infrastructures can take is based on *ideology* that produces a particular form of technology, and then the near dominance of that technology in turn reinforces that ideology. 
- So, we will briefly describe that ideology as illustrated by the prior sections, project the next era of what that looks like with total surveillance hell and chatbots, and then articulate an alternative ideology.




There are many possible outcomes for both of these projects. Funding could dry up tomorrow. In the usual style of academics, the work could lumber on for years and amount to very little beyond proofs of concept. Who knows, they could even produce a few functional platforms that do more or less what their creators intended them to do. 

In both of these projects, the pursuit of a universal knowledge graph is motivated by altruistic goals --- that those goals take the form of the universal knowledge graph is not a matter of stupidity or malice, but ideology.


Before returning to 


- the critical thing here is that the US's two major public funding bodies have lined up to build unifying graphs of everything for ostensibly noble purposes but the information companies are literally licking their chops to eat this up. They have both effectively made new funding mechanisms that allow them to basically let private industry types what to build and how to build it, the academics get invited in to play for a bit, and then it's time to capture it later. The specifics aren't important, what's important is the pattern of layering public and private knowledge graphs that seem great and open on the surface but actually power some monstrously shittier technology underneath.
- Census of outcomes at the end - it could be really bad, it could actually not amount to anything at all, but regardless this is illustrative of the way that the cloud constrains our thinking! Either nonfunctional or corporate! Note how much has been spent on each and give caveats like "ya these might not even amount to anything, but the point is the way that the existing cloud paradigm constrains the way that we think precisely in such a way that it is difficult to actually build the kind of effective infrastructure that we want. We have to acknowledge that the cloud model is not a universal computing paradigm, but one designed for a very specific mode of property relationships and profit models."

Scraps:

- I mean what could be different? how do we get out of the loop of trying to make "ok the real unified knowledge base for real this time guys" loop {% cite hoytUnifyingIdentificationBiomedical2022 %}. Maybe it's the belief that there should be a single unified naming system that's pathological? Maybe we need to focus on linking these things together rather than projecting them into some singular space.
- it is, in fact ideological! "SPOKE was conceived with the philosophy that if relevant information is connected, it can result in the emergence of knowledge, and hence provide insights into the understanding of diseases, discovering of drugs and proactively improving personal health." {% cite morrisScalablePrecisionMedicine2023 %}
- the hollow middle, right? like why is it so hard for me to even find all the ontologies that have been made by the biomedical translator project? why are most of the API endpoints in arax dead *already* - it hasn't even launched! why aren't there the tools for me to actually *use the information* in a way that wasn't specifically designed for in the platform? by focusng the design into these API-based data sources with platforms strapped on top of them, the project is limited to *only exactly what the developers could imagine and are capable of doing* rather than fulfullig the initial definition (find cite) of what "platforms" meant - an enabling technology that allows an expansive space of use that goes beyond the creators and enables and empowers people!
