[^triplets]: Equivalently, one could emphasize that they are graphs composed of **triplet** links that describe some subject, predicate, and object.

[^dois]: For another example re: the political nature of the DOI system in the face of the arbitrary linking of the internet, see section 3.1.2 "[Integration, not Invention](https://jon-e.net/infrastructure/#seemingly-prosocial-protocols-can-be-used-by-industries-to-preem)" in {% cite saundersDecentralizedInfrastructureNeuro2022 %}

[^fbgraph]: Facebook describes the notion of its platform as being just a means of interacting with its underlying data graph in corporate web design speak: "A useful tool for Facebook has been to think of the graph as the model and a Facebook page as the view—a projection of an entity or collection of entities that reside in the graph." {% cite noyIndustryscaleKnowledgeGraphs2019 %}

[^etsydb]: For a practical example, see a recent [trio](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/scaling-etsy-payments-with-vitess-part-1--the-data-model) of [blog](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/scaling-etsy-payments-with-vitess-part-2--the-seamless-migration) [posts](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/scaling-etsy-payments-with-vitess-part-3--reducing-cutover-risk) from Etsy engineers that describe the process of scaling their database system.

[^notmagic]: I am aware graph databases are not magic and this is an extraordinarily simplified example. The principle is the point, not all the subtle ways the implementations of graph databases are hard.

[^RELXStrugs]: Though apparently they have had historical difficulty actually getting that integration to work {% cite schonfeldReorganizationElsevier2022 %}.

[^infoindustry]: To the degree that it can be considered an "industry" rather than a "mode of extraction."

[^integration]: > That is because knowledge graphs aim to solve the data incongruence problem, which is one of the biggest operational headaches for corporates, says Atkin.  “Corporates suffer from technology fragmentation and as a result have a lot of data that doesn’t align across the organization. Doing the hard work to fix this data incongruence reality is a pre-requisite for realizing business value,” he says. {% cite schenkerNewReportDetails2021 %}

[^freesoftware]: "free as in whatever will prevent you from @'ing me about getting some definition of free wrong."

[^wikipedia]: I have written about the peculiar structure of Wikipedia among wikis previously, section 3.4.1 - "[The Wiki Way](https://jon-e.net/infrastructure/#the-wiki-way)" {% cite saundersDecentralizedInfrastructureNeuro2022 %}

[^crowdsource]: For critical work on crowdsourcing in the context of "open science," see {% cite mirowskiFutureOpenScience2018 %}, and in the semantic web see {% cite allhutterWorkingOntologistsHighQuality2019 %}.

[^rdfavmicroformats]: (Intervening messages in the [chat log](https://www.w3.org/2011/06/semtech-bof-notes.html) have been omitted for clarity):<br>
    
    `<tantek>` Hey Kavi - do you see what you've done here?
    <br>
    `<tantek>` You've gotten a community leader of microformats.org (myself) and chair of W3C RDFa WG to \*agree\*
	<br>
	`<edsu>` tantek: see, that's progress :)
	<br>
	`<manu-db>` Yes - both RDFa and Microformats communities agree - sky will be falling, next.

[^linkingagreements]: "The potential benefit of the service that would become CrossRef was immediately apparent. Organizations such as AIP and IOP (Institute of Physics) had begun to link to each other’s publications, and the impossibility of replicating such one-off arrangements across the industry was obvious. As Tim Ingoldsby later put it, **'All those linking agreements were going to kill us.'**" {% cite crossrefFormationCrossRefShort2009 %}

[^diygoogle]: Go ahead, try and make your own web crawler to compete with Google - all the information is just out there in public on the open web!
