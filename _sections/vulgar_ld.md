# Towards a Vulgar Linked Data

Note that we are specifically talking about applying prior art in the realm of linked data, not inventing something new! Extending Poirier's typology in service of articulating a concrete emancipatory alternative, not columbusing a whole broad field of thought.

Components:
	- (Same as in infra piece?)
	- Pluralism: (ch. 5 of {% cite dignazioDataFeminism2020 %})
	- Contextual/Relational: (ch 6 of data feminism and also datasheets for datasets, and piece from leslie about indigenous ways of knowing)
	- Degrowth
	- Explicitly antioppression (within bounds of tactics) - fuck you google!
