The world is Big Data, and The Cloud is its landlord. Much like the universal commodification of prior {% cite warkCapitalDeadThis2021 %} assemblages of capitalism, The Cloud's informational capitalism recasts every element of our reality as Data, and it is our responsibility to ferret it out of its primitive unknown, mine it, harvest it, dump it by the tanker-truckful into great Data Lakes and wring the Actionable Insights from its neck. The world has always been Big with Data, but The Cloud has finally given us a fruit of knowledge to munch on that reveals its true nature. We are but Data Subjects, and if we can harness the wily spray of our Organic Content with biosensor wearables, filtering our every action, affection, and affilitation through a mob of algorithmically optimized platforms, then The Cloud might teach us enough about ourselves to be able to lead a fulfilled and healthy life. Academics and Governments in particular are filthy with Data, and have set their eyes on a new generation of data infrastructures that promise to dissolve the Silos that prevent the Big Data from teaching us the nature of the universe, how to solve poverty, reverse climate change, and finally collapse into one great cat-pile of peace and love for our neighbor. The Cloud is dreaming of linking the Big Data into one great Knowledge Graph of Everything --- it tells us this is important for the fate of humanity.

The Knowledge Graph of Everything is a mirage, though. Its vision of extracting all the world's data is the same colonial vision of infinite prosperity that has driven us to the brink of extinction: So The Cloud Said, let us make Platforms in our image, and let them have dominion over the interactions with the apps, and the insights of the analytics, and over all the data of the earth. The pursuit of universalizing ontologies that will finally give every quantum of Data its one True and Correct form is the same fascistic vision that has driven eliminationist campaigns to stamp out degeneracy: Ontologien Ã¼ber alles. Aside from its properly pathological nature, the Knowledge Graph of Everything *is impossible* and *won't work.* Instead, The Cloud will lead governments and academics along by the nose just long enough to build critical mass for an interlocking set of platforms that slice off snapshots of the Everything to ratchet us ever futher into the captivity of surveillance and subscription. 

What is the alternative? The Cloud presents its future as inevitable, but by seeing past its logic we might imagine properly *human* infrastructures that fill the needs for connection and understanding that it exploits. This piece develops the notion of **vulgar linked data** as an alternative to the Cloud Orthodoxy. Predicated on relationality, heterogeneity, privacy, and vernacular expression, vulgar linked data infrastructures attempt to empower *people* to *socially organize* information in a truly decentralized sociotechnological commons, rather than empowering *systems* to *rent* knowledge organization for *profit.*
